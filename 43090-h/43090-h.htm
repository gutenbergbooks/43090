SKINNING, PREPARING, AND MOUNTING THE MAMMALIA, OR
QUADRUPEDS.</h2>

<h3>SKINNING.</h3>

<p>When a quadruped is killed, and its skin intended for stuffing,
the preparatory steps are to lay the animal on its back,
and plug up its nostrils, mouth, and any wounds it may have
received, with cotton or tow, to prevent the blood from disfiguring
the skin. The fox will serve admirably our purpose
as an example. Therefore, Reynard being procured, we need
not say how, lay him on his back in the same position as before
recommended; and, having first stuffed the mouth with
cotton and tied it up, and measured his neck and body with
rule and calipers, and noted them, proceed. Make an incision
from the last rib nearly to the vent, but not quite up to it.
Having done so, proceed to raise the skin all round the incision
as far as the thighs, first skinning one side and then
the other, using the flat end of the knife in preference to the
blade to raise the skin. Having reached the hind legs, separate
the latter at the femur or thigh-bone, close to the
backbone, leaving the legs attached to the skin. Now skin
the head-quarters close up to the tail, and separate from the
body at the last vertebræ, taking care not to injure the skin.
Pull the skin over the heads of the hip-joints, and now the
carcass may be suspended by the hind-quarters, while the
skin is stripped by pulling it gently and cutting towards the
fore-quarters. The fore legs are separated from the body, as
the hind ones had been, close to the shoulder-bone, and the
skin pulled fairly over the head and close to the nose, when
the head is separated from the body by cutting through the
last vertebræ of the neck. Reynard is now skinned, the
head, legs and tail being all attached to the skin, from which
the carcass is separated.</p>

<p>The flesh is now cut entirely away from the cheek-bones,
the eyes removed, the brains taken out by enlarging the occipi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>tal
opening behind the cranium, the whole cleaned and supplied
with a coating of arsenical paste, and stuffed with tow
or wool, to the natural size.</p>

<p>The legs are now successively skinned by pushing out the
bones and inverting the skin over them until the foot-joint is
visible; every portion of flesh and tendons must be cut away,
and the bone cleaned thoroughly, and a coating of arsenical
soap laid over it as well as the skin. Wrap tow, or cotton,
or any other suitable material, round the bone, bringing it to
its natural shape, and draw the skin over it again. Do this to
each leg in succession, and the body itself is ready for stuffing
and mounting.</p>

<p>The utmost care will not prevent accidents; the fur and
plumage will get sullied, and before stuffing it is well to examine
the skin, for stains and spots are calculated to deteriorate
its appearance. Grease or blood-spots may be removed
by brushing over with oil of turpentine, which is afterwards
absorbed by dusting plaster of Paris over. Macgillivray
recommends that all skins, whether they are to be put away
in a cabinet or stuffed, should receive a washing of spirits of
turpentine sprinkled on, and gently brushed in the direction
of the feathers or fur.</p>

<p>Not to trust too much to memory, it is desirable to measure
and note the proportions of the animal before skinning, first
taking the muzzle to the tail. Afterwards, from the junction
of the tail to the tip. Secondly, from the middle of the
shoulder-blade, or scapula, to the articulation of the femur,
or thigh-bone. Thirdly, the animal being placed on its side,
measure from the upper part of the scapula to the middle of
the sternum&mdash;that is, to the spot where the two sides meet
above, and finally from the socket of the scapula to the socket
of the articulation of the femur, or thigh-bone. In addition
to these, note, by measurement with caliper compasses, the
size of the head, the neck, the tail, and other points which
affect the shape of the animal. These measurements will
serve as a guide in stuffing, and for the size of the case and
length of the mounting wires. In the process of skinning, it
is important to avoid penetrating to the intestines, or separating
any of the abdominal muscles which lead to the intestines;
any such accident would be very disagreeable, as
well as injurious to the skin.</p>

<h3>STUFFING QUADRUPEDS, ETC.</h3>

<p>Let us suppose the animal which we intend to stuff, to be
a Cat. Wire of such a thickness is chosen as will support the
animal by being introduced under the soles of the feet, and
running it through each of the four legs. A piece of smaller
dimensions is then taken, measuring about two feet, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
purpose of forming what is termed by stuffers a tail-bearer.
This piece of wire is bent at nearly a third of its length, into
an oval of about six inches in length; the two ends are
twisted together, so as to leave one of them somewhat longer
than the other; the tail is then correctly measured, and the
wire is cut to the length of it, besides the oval. The wire is
then wrapped round with flax in a spiral form, which must
be increased in thickness as it approaches the oval, so as to
be nearly equal to the dimensions of the largest vertebræ, or
root of the tail. When finished, it should be rubbed thinly
over with flour-paste, to preserve its smooth form, which must
be allowed to dry thoroughly, and then the surface should receive
a coating of the preservative. The sheath of the tail
must now be rubbed inside with the preservative. This is
applied with a small quantity of lint, attached to the end of a
wire, long enough to reach the point of the tail-sheath. The
tail-bearer is then inserted into the sheath, and the oval part
of the wire placed within the skin of the belly, and attached
to the longitudinal wire, which is substituted for the vertebræ
or backbone.</p>

<p>Four pieces of wire, about the thickness of a crow-quill,
are then taken, which must be the length of the legs, and another
piece a foot or fifteen inches longer than the body. One
end of each of these is sharpened with a file, in a triangular
shape, so that it may the more easily penetrate the parts. At
the blunt end of the longest piece a ring is formed, large
enough to admit of the point of a finger entering it; this is
done by bending the wire back on itself a turn and a half, by
the assistance of the round pincers. On the same wire another
ring is formed in a similar manner, consisting of one
entire turn, and so situated as to reach just between the animal&rsquo;s
shoulders. The remaining part of this wire should be
perfectly straight, and triangularly pointed at the extremity.</p>

<p>All the wires being adjusted, the operation of stuffing is
next proceeded with. The skin of the Cat is now extended
on a table; and the end of the noose seized with the left
hand, and pushed again into the skin, till it reaches the neck,
when we receive the bones of the head into the right hand.
The skull is now well rubbed over with the arsenical soap,
and all the cavities which the muscles before occupied are
filled with chopped tow, flax, or cotton well mixed with preserving
powder. The long piece of wire is now passed into
the middle of the skull, and after it is well rubbed over with
the preservative, it is returned into the skin. The inner surface
of the neck-skin is now anointed, and stuffed with
chopped flax, taking care not to distend it too much. Nothing
like pressure should be applied, as the fresh skin is susceptible
of much expansion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Observe that it is always the inner surface which is anointed
with the arsenical soap.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 1.</i></p>
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="535" height="600" alt="" />
<p><i>Manner of inserting the wires in mounting a Cat.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Take care that the first ring of the wire, which passes into
the head, is in the direction of the shoulders, and the second
corresponding with the pelvis, or somewhat towards the posterior
part. One of the fore-leg wires is then inserted along
the back of the bone, and the point passed out under the
highest ball of the paw. When this is accomplished, the
bones of the leg are drawn up within the skin of the body,
and the wire fastened to the bones of the arm and fore-arm
with strong thread, or small twine. Brass wire, used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
piano-forte strings, makes it more secure, and is not liable to
rot. These are well anointed, and flax or tow <i>slivers</i>
wrapped round them, so as to supply the place of the muscles
which have been removed. To give the natural rise to
the larger muscles, a piece of silver should be cut off the
length of the protuberance required, and placed in the part,
and the silver wrapped over it. This gives it a very natural
appearance.</p>

<p>The mode of fixing the legs is by passing one of their pieces
of wire into the small ring of the horizontal or middle supporting
wire. Pursue the same plan with the other leg, and
then twist the two ends firmly together, by the aid of a pair
of flat pincers. For an animal of the size of a Cat the pieces
left for twisting must be from five to six inches in length.
After being twisted, they are bound on the under side of the
body-wire with strong thread; the two legs are then replaced
and put in the form in which we intend to fix them. The
skin of the belly and top of the shoulders are then anointed,
and a thick layer of flax placed under the middle wire. The
shape is now given to the scapulæ on both sides, and all the
muscles of the shoulders imitated. These will be elevated or
depressed, according to the action intended to be expressed.
The anterior part of the opening is now sewed up, to retain
the stuffing and to enable us to complete the formation of
the shoulders and the junction of the neck. This part of the
animal is of great importance as regards the perfection of its
form; and much of its beauty will depend upon this being
well executed.</p>

<p>If the animal has been recently skinned, the best plan possible
is to imitate, as nearly as possible, the muscles of the
carcass; by which many parts will be noticed which might
otherwise have been neglected. As a rule, copy Nature whenever
you have it in your power.</p>

<p>It must be observed, as a general rule, that the wires for the
hind legs of quadrupeds should always be longer than those of
the fore legs.</p>

<p>The next thing is to form the hind legs and thighs, which
must be done, as above described for the fore legs; but with
this difference, that they must be wound round with thread,
drawn through the stuffing at intervals, to prevent it slipping
up when returned into the skin of the leg. They are then
fixed, by passing the leg wires into a second ring of the center
body wire, which is situated at or near the pelvis; the two
ends are then bent, twisting them to the right and left around
the ring: and to make them still more secure, they should be
wound round with small brass wire or pack-thread; the tail-bearer
is then attached in the manner formerly described.</p>

<p>Having completed this part of the iron work, the skin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the thighs is coated inside with the preservative, and the
stuffing completed with chopped flax or tow. The whole
inner parts of the skin which can be reached are again
anointed, and the body stuffing completed with chopped flax.
Care must be also paid not to stuff the belly too much, as the
skin very easily dilates. The incision in the belly is now
closed by bringing the skin together, and then sewing within
and without, while attention is paid to divide the hairs, and
not to take any of them in along with the thread; but should
any of them be inadvertently fixed, they can be picked out
easily with a point. When this is completed, the hair will
resume its natural order and completely conceal the seam.</p>

<p>The seam should now be well primed on both sides with the
solution of corrosive sublimate, to prevent the entrance of
moths.</p>

<p>The articulations of the legs are then bent, and the animal
placed on its feet, and pressure used at the natural flat places,
so as to make the other parts rise where the muscles are visible.</p>

<p>A board is now prepared, on which to place the Cat. But
before fixing it permanently, the animal should be set in the
attitude in which it is intended to be preserved, and the operator,
having satisfied himself, then pierces four holes for the
admission of the feet wires, which must be drawn through
with a pair of pincers till the paws rest firmly on the board.
Small grooves are then made for the reception of the pieces of
wires which have been drawn through, so that they may be
folded back and pressed down in them, and not be beyond
the level of the back of the board; wire nails are now driven
half in, and their heads bent down on the wires to prevent
them from getting loose, or becoming movable.</p>

<p>The stuffer next directs his attention to the position and
final stuffing of the head and neck. The muscles of the face
must be imitated as correctly as possible, by stuffing in cotton
at the opening of the eyes, as also at the mouth, ears, and
nostrils. To aid in this, also, the inner materials may be
drawn forward by the assistance of instruments, and also
small pieces of wood formed like small knitting meshes.</p>

<p>Our next care is the insertion of the eyes, which must be
done while the eyelids are yet fresh. Some dexterity and
skill are required in this operation, and on it will depend
most of the beauty and character of the head. The seats of
the eyes are supplied with a little cement, the eyes put in
their place, and the eyelids properly drawn over the eyeballs:
but if rage or fear are to be expressed, a considerable portion
of the eyeballs must be exposed. The lips are afterwards disposed
in their natural state, and fastened with pins. If the
mouth is intended to be open, it will be necessary to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the lips with cotton, which can be removed when they are
dry. Two small balls of cotton, firmly pressed together, and
well tinctured with the arsenical soap, must be thrust into
the nostrils so as to completely plug them up to prevent the
air from penetrating, as also the intrusion of moths; and besides,
it has the effect of preserving the natural shape of the
nose after it has dried. The same precaution should be
adopted with the ears, which, in the Cat, require but little attention
in setting.</p>

<p>We must again recommend the stuffer to see that he has
sufficiently applied the preservative soap; and the nose, lips,
eyes, and paws, being very liable to decay, must be well imbued
with spirits of turpentine. This is applied with a brush,
and must be repeated six or eight times, at intervals of some
days, until we are certain of the parts being well primed with
it; and, after all, it will be advisable to give it a single coating
of the solution of corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p>The methods of stuffing, which we have pointed out in the
preceding pages, are applicable to all animals, from a Lion
down to the smallest Mouse. Animals of a large description
require a frame-work suited to their dimensions; these he will
point out in their order. There are also some animals
whose peculiarity of structure requires treatment differing a
little from the ordinary course.</p>

<h3>APES AND MONKEYS.</h3>

<p>One of the chief difficulties to contend with, in setting up
Monkeys and Apes, is the preservation of their hands and
hind hands, or what we commonly call their feet; because we
must not attempt to deprive these limbs of their flesh, as we
never could again supply its place anything like what is in
nature. The hands must therefore be dried, and then well
imbued with turpentine and the solution of corrosive sublimate,
repeated eight or ten times at least, at intervals of four
or five days. The other parts of the stuffing should be exactly
similar to that recommended for quadrupeds generally.
The paws of several will require to be colored with the different
varnishes, and, when dry, slightly polished with fine sand-paper
to remove the gloss. The callosities, on the hinder
parts of many of them, will also require to be colored, and
treated in the same way as the face.</p>

<h3>BATS.</h3>

<p>The wing-membranes of this varied and numerous tribe do
not require either wire or parchment to set them. They are
very easily dried by distension. They are laid on a board of
soft wood, the wings extended and pinned equally at the
articulations, and, when dry, they are removed from the
board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<h3>HEDGEHOGS.</h3>

<p>When it is wished to preserve Hedgehogs, rolled into a
ball, which is a very common position with them in a state of
nature, there should be less stuffing put into them than is
usual with quadrupeds, so that they may the more easily
bend. No wires are required in this case. The head and feet
are drawn close together under the belly; then place the animal
on its back in the middle of a large cloth, and tie the
four ends firmly together; suspend it in the air till thoroughly
dry, which finishes the operation.</p>

<p>If Hedgehogs are wished with the heads and limbs exposed,
the usual method of mounting is adopted. The skins
of Mice, Moles, etc., having a very offensive smell, it will be
necessary to add a considerable portion of the tincture of
musk to the solution of the corrosive sublimate with which
the skins are imbued. The same applies to Badgers, Wolverenes,
Polecats and Skunks, all of which are strong-smelling
animals.</p>

<h3>BEARS.</h3>

<p>The structure of the wires requires to be different in these
larger animals from any we have before described.</p>

<p>Procure a bar one inch thick, two inches broad, and as long
as to reach horizontally from the shoulder to the connection of
the thighs, or <i>os pubis</i>. A hole is bored four inches distant
from one of its ends, from which a connecting groove must be
formed, extending on both sides to the end of the plank next
the hole; this groove must be cut out with a hollow chisel
deep enough to receive the wire. The wire is then passed
through it, one end of which is just long enough to be twisted
with the other at the end of the plank. The wire on both
sides is now pressed down into the grooves, and twisted firmly
together by the aid of a pair of strong pincers. Pierce some
holes obliquely into the groove and insert some wire nails into
them, which must be firmly driven home, and then bent over
the wire to keep them firm. The longest end of the wire
should be at least eighteen inches beyond the bar, so as to
pass through the skull of the animal.</p>

<p>The use of this bar, it will be observed, is a substitute for the
central or supporting wires of the body. Two other holes are
now bored into it, the one two, and the other three inches
from the end which we first pierced; these are for the reception
of the wires of the forelegs; and two similar holes must
be made at the other extremity of the bar for receiving the
wires of the hind legs.</p>

<p>Bears always support themselves on the full expansion of
their dilated paws, so that it is necessary to bring the leg-wires
out of the claws. The leg-wires are bent at right angles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
for a length of five inches from the upper end. These are put
through the holes in the bar, and when they have passed
through they are curved again. Two small gimlet-holes are
then made for the reception of smaller wire, by which the
leg-wires must be bound together close to the bar. The fore-leg
wires are fixed in the same manner, which completes the
frame-work.</p>

<p>No other means are used for middle-sized animals, such as
the Lion, Tiger, Leopard, etc. The stuffing is completed as
in other quadrupeds.</p>

<p>The Walrus, Seals, and other amphibious animals of this
order, are treated in the manner of quadrupeds generally,
only that leg-wires are unnecessary, except in the fore-feet;
the tail, which represents the hind feet, has merely to be dried
and kept properly stretched in during this process, which precaution
also applies to the fore-feet. They are the easiest
stuffed of all animals, only the skins are very oily; they should
be well rubbed with the arsenical soap, and also with the preserving
powder.</p>

<p>The stuffing of the Walrus, and other large animals of this
family, should consist of well-dried hay for the interior parts,
and tow for the surface next the skin.</p>

<h3>BEAVER, ETC.</h3>

<p>The Beaver, Musk Rat, Common Rat, and other animals
whose skins have a strong smell. These require to be plentifully
supplied with the preservative. The tail of the Beaver
should be cut underneath, and all the flesh removed, then
stuffed with tow or chopped flax, and afterwards thoroughly
dried and well primed with the arsenical soap to prevent
putrefaction, to which it is very liable. It should also have
repeated washings with oil of turpentine. The back should
be round and short.</p>

<h3>THE PORCUPINE.</h3>

<p>In stuffing this animal considerable and varied expression
may be given, both from the attitude and disposition of the
quills. Great attention is therefore required in giving these a
proper set during the process of drying. They will require
to be looked at several times during the first and second day
after they have been stuffed, and any of them that may have
fallen out of the position required, to be adjusted.</p>

<h3>HARES AND RABBITS.</h3>

<p>A very pretty attitude for the Hare or Rabbit, is to have it
seated in its form in an upright position, as if alarmed at the
noise of dogs, etc. An oval is formed of wire and attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to the interior frame-work, after having passed one end of it
through the anus, which must be passed through a hole in the
board on which the animal is to be fixed. The wires of the
hind legs must be forced through the posterior part of them,
and also fixed into holes formed for their reception in the
board.</p>

<h3>DEER, ANTELOPES, GOATS, ETC.</h3>

<p>These animals should be mounted on the same principles
as recommended for the Bears. A different mode must, however,
be adopted in skinning the animals, which the horns
render necessary. It is performed in the ordinary manner
until the operator reaches the neck. After cutting as near
the head as possible, another incision must be made, commencing
under the chin, which is continued to the bottom of
the neck, or from eight to ten inches in length. By this opening,
the remainder of the neck is separated from the head;
the tongue is cut out, and the occipital orifice enlarged, and
the brain extracted thereby. The lips are now cut as near as
possible to the jaw-bones, and the operator must continue
progressively ascending towards the forehead, and in this
manner all the skin will be separated from the head, except
at the nose, or point of the muzzle. All the muscles are next
removed by the scalpel, and the skull well anointed with
arsenical soap. The muscles which have been cut out are then
imitated with chopped flax or cotton, which may be attached
to the bones with cement. When this is done, the head must
be replaced within the skin. The orifice under the neck must
now be sewed up with fine stitches, so that the hair may
spread over them to conceal the seam. The whole other
parts of the mounting is complete as directed for the Bear.</p>

<h3>THE DOLPHIN, PORPOISE, ETC.</h3>

<p>The structure of these animals, as well as the other species
of the first family of this order, differs but little in general
structure.</p>

<p>In skinning these, an incision is made under the chin, and
continued to the extremity of the tail; the skin is then detached
right and left with the scalpel, or a sharp knife.
When the skin has been cut back as far as possible, disengage
the vertebræ at the tail, and this will enable the operator to
detach the skin from the back; the vertebræ are now cut
close to the head, and the whole carcass removed.</p>

<p>All this tribe have a thick layer of fat under their skin. In
the operation of skinning it requires considerable dexterity to
leave this fat, or blubber, adhering to the carcass. Practice
alone will obviate this. When this has not been properly
managed in the skinning, the only thing to be done after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>wards
is to scrape it thoroughly with a knife. The oil which
flows from it, during this operation, must be soaked up with
bran, or plaster of Paris.</p>

<p>There being no muscular projections in the skin of the Porpoise,
there is no use for wires in mounting it. A narrow
piece of wood the length of the body is quite sufficient to keep
the skin stretched, and stuffed either with tow or hay. Some
months are necessary to render it perfectly dry and stiff, from
its greasy nature. The grease almost always leaves some
disagreeable-looking spots on the skin. To remove these,
and prevent a recurrence of them, powdered pumice-stone
steeped in olive-oil, is rubbed thickly on the skin with a hand-brush.
It is then gone over a second time with emery and
oil. It is rubbed in this way till the skin has a glossy appearance,
when it may be rubbed dry with a woolen cloth;
and to complete the polish, a clean woolen cloth may be applied
with some force to complete the gloss which is natural
to the skin in a living state.</p>

<p>Where a very glossy appearance is wished, varnishes become
necessary, but some difficulty has been experienced in
getting these to remain attached to the skin in all weathers,
because the humidity of rainy seasons melts gum-arabic when
it is used as a varnish, and when white varnish is applied,
both it and the gum-arabic fall off in pieces. To prevent the
gum from falling off in this way, by its contracting, the solution
should have about an eighth part of ox-gall mixed with
it, and the surface of any body to be varnished should be
washed with ox-gall and water before the varnish is applied,
which will, almost to a certainty, present it from cracking
and falling off. It must, however, be thoroughly dried before
the varnish is applied.</p>

<p>We may here state, that an animal the size of a Fox or a Cat,
may be skinned, prepared, and finally set up, in the space of
four or five hours, by a person who has had a little practice
in the art of Taxidermy, and that from ten to fifteen minutes
are all that will be required to skin an animal of the size just
mentioned.</p>

SKINNING, PRESERVING, AND MOUNTING BIRDS.</h2>

<h3>SKINNING.</h3>

<p>Immediately after a bird is killed, the throat and nostrils
should be stuffed with tow, cotton, or fine rags, and a small
quantity wound round the bill to prevent the blood from
staining the plumage; but should any get on the feathers,
notwithstanding this precaution, the sooner it is removed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
better, which should be effected by a sponge which has been
merely moistened in water. Too much dispatch cannot be
used in removing the skin, if the bird is shot in a warm climate;
but, in temperate regions, the bird may be allowed to
cool.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 2.</i></p>
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" />
<p><i>Manner of holding the hands in skinning a bird.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In proceeding to skin the bird, it should be laid on its back,
and the feathers of the breast separated to the right and left,
when a broad interval will be discovered, reaching from the
top to the bottom of the breast-bone. (See fig. 2.)</p>

<p>(See fig. 2 for the manner of separating the feathers and using
the scalpel.) A sharp pen-knife, or scalpel, must be inserted
at the point of the bone, and cut the outer skin from thence
to the vent, taking care not to penetrate so deep as the flesh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
or upon the inner skin which covers the intestines. The skin
will then easily be separated from the flesh; in larger specimens,
by the fingers, or, in smaller ones, by passing a small
blunt instrument betwixt the skin and body, such as the end
of the scalpel-handle; with this you may reach the back. The
thighs should now be pressed inward, as in the common method
of skinning a rabbit, and the skin turned back, so far as to
enable you to separate the legs from the body, at the knee-joint.
The skin is then pulled downwards, as low as the
rump, which is cut close by the insertion of the tail, as shown
in fig. 2, but in such a manner as not to injure its feathers.
The skin is now drawn upwards the length of the wings, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
bones of which must also be cut at the shoulder-joints; it is
then pulled up, till all the back part of the skull is laid bare,
when the vertebræ of the neck are separated from the head,
and the whole body is now separated from the skin. You
next proceed to remove the brain, through the opening of the
skull, for which purpose it may be enlarged by a hollow
chisel, or other iron instrument. The eyes must then be taken
out, by breaking the slender bones which separate the orbits
from the top of the mouth, in which you may be assisted by
pressing the eyes gently inwards, so as not to break them.
In skinning the neck great care must be taken not to enlarge
the opening of the ears, and not to injure the eyelids. The
whole of the flesh is next to be removed from the under mandible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 3.</i></p>
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="425" height="600" alt="" />
<p><i>Bird suspended for skinning.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Several species will not admit of the skin being thus pulled
over their heads, from the smallness of their necks; some
Woodpeckers, Ducks, etc., fall under this description; in
which case a longitudinal incision is made under the throat,
so as to admit of the head being turned out, which must be
neatly sewed up before stuffing. The flesh from the head,
wings, legs, and rump, must then be carefully removed with
a knife, and the cavities of the skull filled with cotton or tow.
The whole inside of the skin, head, etc., must be well rubbed
with arsenical soap, or preserving powder, or spirit of turpentine,
or the solution of corrosive sublimate. When it is wished
to stuff the bird, it may now be immediately done, as it will
easily dry, if in a warm climate; but in low, damp countries,
it will require artificial heat to do it effectually.</p>

<p>When the skins are merely wished preserved, the bones of
the legs and wings should be wrapped round with cotton or
tow, so as to supply the place of the flesh; the skin is then
inverted and hung up to dry, after using the arsenical soap,
as above directed; before doing which, in larger birds, a
thread or small string may be drawn through the rump, and
passed up to the inside of the neck, and drawn through
the bill, to prevent the head from stretching too much by its
own weight. In larger specimens, where cotton or tow is
not easily to be met with, well-dried hay may be used.</p>

<p>The incision for removing the skin is frequently made under
the wings. This may be done with marine birds to advantage.
The Penguins and Divers may be skinned by making
the incision in the back.</p>

<p>The tongue should either be kept in the mouth, or sent
home separately with the birds.</p>

<p>The greatest care must be taken to prevent the fat and oily
matter, so common to sea-birds, from getting on the feathers;
pounded chalk will be found an excellent absorbent for applying
to these birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>In sending home specimens of birds, they should be each
wrapped in paper, and closely packed in a box; and camphor,
preserving powder, and strong aromatics, strewn amongst
them, to prevent them from being attacked by insects; and
they ought to be kept in a very dry part of the vessel.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost consequence to know the color of the
eyes and legs of birds, and these things should be carefully
noted the moment they are killed; and it should also be mentioned
whether they are male or female; such a memorandum
ought to be attached to the birds by a ticket. The season of
the year in which the bird is killed, must also be mentioned.
It is also of much consequence to have good skeletons, and,
for this purpose, the carcasses may be sent home in a barrel,
either in spirits or a strong solution of salt and water.</p>

<p>Mr. Salt, while in Abyssinia, packed his bird-skins between
sheets of paper, and in the same manner as a <i>hortus siccus</i>,
or herbarium, and they reached England in perfect safety,
and made excellent specimens when set up. In warm climates,
the boxes should be well closed, and the seams filled
with warm pitch on the outside, to prevent the intrusion of
insects; and the inside should be supplied with camphor,
musk, or tobacco-dust, which will prevent the attacks of the
smaller insects.</p>

<p>Till practice has given facility to the operator, it will assist
in keeping the feathers clean, if, as he opens the skin of the
breast, he pins pieces of paper or linen cloth on the outside,
but after a few trials this will be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Some of the marine fowls are so fat that there is much
trouble in separating it from the skin, and in warm weather,
great attention will be required to prevent it from running on
the feathers. As much as possible should be scraped off, in the
first place, with a blunt table-knife or palate-knife, and a quantity
of powdered chalk applied, to absorb what remains, which,
when saturated with the oily matter, should be scraped off
and a fresh supply used, after which a much larger proportion
of the preserving powder should be applied than in other
birds which are not fat.</p>

<p>When shooting on the sea-coast, if the ornithologist is not
provided with these requisites for absorbing the oil, which
flows quickly from any wounds of the skin, he will find dry
sand a tolerable substitute.</p>

<p>If, however, after every precaution, the oily matter should
get on the feathers, the sooner it is removed the better, as, in
birds where the plumage is white, if it is allowed to become
hardened it will produce a very disagreeable appearance;
and, besides, render that part particularly liable to the attack
of insects. There are several effectual methods of removing
the greasy stains; the first, safest, and best, is, by taking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
quantity of diluted ox-gall&mdash;or, where it cannot be commanded,
sheep&rsquo;s-gall, or that of any other animal&mdash;mix it
with about double the quantity of water, and apply it with a
sponge to the place which the fatty matter has touched, when
it will immediately remove it. The next is by using a solution
of salt of tartar, or potash, or soda. This must be made
very weak, not exceeding half a tea-spoonful to a cup of
water, which will have the same effect as the gall. Whichever
of these are used, the place must be immediately afterwards
washed in pure water, so as to leave none of the gall
or alkaline substance remaining. The gall has a gummy
tendency, and will glue together the fibers of the feathers,
and, besides, it has a great attraction for moisture, and, in
humid weather, will become damp, and therefore produce
mold; the other alkaline substances must also be used with
much caution and quickness, because they have the power of
changing the colors of the plumage, so that they are most
useful in white plumage, and therefore should only be used on
colored feathers, where gall cannot be procured.</p>

<p>One general observation applies to the preservation of all
animal skins, which is, they must be made perfectly dry, so
that the sooner they are exposed to a free current of air the
better; and unless they are speedily and thoroughly dried, the
skin will become putrid and rotten, and the hair or feathers
will consequently fall off. If a skin is properly dried, soon
after it is killed, it will keep a considerable time without any
preservative whatever, only it will be the more liable to be
attacked by insects afterwards.</p>

<p>The following excellent general directions for skinning are
given by Mr. Waterton:&mdash;&ldquo;While dissecting, it will be of use
to keep in mind, that in taking off the skin from the body, by
means of your fingers and little knife, you must try to shove
it, in lieu of pulling it, lest you stretch it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you must press as lightly as possible on the bird, and
every now and then take a view of it, to see that the feathers,
etc., are all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That when you come to the head, you must take care that
the body of the skin rest on your knee, for if you allow it
to dangle from your hand, its own weight will stretch it too
much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, throughout the whole operation, as fast as you detach
the skin from the body, you must put cotton immediately
betwixt the body and it, and this will effectually prevent
any fat, blood, or moisture from coming in contact with the
plumage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you can seldom get a bird without shooting it, a line
or two on this head will be necessary. If the bird be still
alive, press it hard, with your finger and thumb, just behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the wings, and it will soon expire. Carry it by the legs, and
then, the body being reversed, the blood cannot escape down
the plumage and through the shot-holes. As blood will have
often issued out, before you have laid hold of the bird, find
out the shot-holes, by dividing the feathers with your fingers,
and blowing on them; and then, with your pen-knife, or the
leaf of a tree, carefully remove the clotted blood, and put a
little cotton on the hole. If, after all, the plumage has not
escaped the marks of blood, or if it has imbibed slime from
the ground, wash the part in water, without soap, and keep
gently agitating the feathers with your fingers, till they are
quite dry. Were you to wash them, and leave them to dry
by themselves, they would have a very mean and shriveled
appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the act of skinning a bird, you must either have it upon
a table, or upon your knee; probably you will prefer your
knee, because, when you cross one knee over the other, and
have the bird upon the uppermost, you can raise it to your
eye, or lower it at pleasure, by means of the foot on the
ground; and then your knee will always move in unison with
your body, by which much stooping will be avoided, and lassitude
prevented.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>STUFFING BIRDS.</h3>

<p>The first thing to be done in stuffing is to replace the skull,
after it has been well anointed with the arsenical soap, and
washed with the solution of corrosive sublimate inside. The
thread with which the beak is tied is taken hold of by the left
hand, and the head is repassed into the neck with the forefinger
of the right hand, while the thread is pulled on the opposite
side; and we are careful that the feathers, at the margin
of the opening, do not enter with the edges of the skin.
The bird is now laid on the table with the head turned towards
the left hand, and the legs and wings adjusted to their
proper situation. A flat piece of lead, about a pound in
weight, is laid on the tail, while the feathers of the margins
of the opening are raised by the forefinger and thumb of the
left hand, to prevent their being soiled. The inside of the
neck is now coated with the arsenical soap; flax is stuffed
into it, but not too tightly. The back and rump are anointed,
and the body should then be stuffed with tow, to about a third
of the thickness required, so that the wire may have a sort of
cushion to rest on.</p>

<p>Four pieces of wire are then prepared, of the thickness
proportionate to the size of the bird to be stuffed. The center-piece
should be somewhat longer than the body of the bird.
At about a fourth of its length a small ring is formed, by the
assistance of the round pincers or pliers, and the other end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
is pointed with a file. This wire is oiled, and introduced
across the skull, and passed into the neck through the center
of the flax or tow with which it is stuffed&mdash;the ring being situated
toward the anterior part of the skull, for the purpose
of receiving the points of each of the wires that are passed
through the feet and thighs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 4 to 7.</i></p>
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="435" height="600" alt="" />
<p><i>4, the oval and head-wires of a bird separated; 5, the
tail-bearers separated; 6, a leg-wire separated; 7, the body-wire,
the head-wire, the tail-bearer and legs connected.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The following is the mode in which this performance is
effected: A hole is bored with a brass awl, the caliber of the
wire which it is intended to use. The wire, which is to continue
in the leg, is passed across the knee, and brought out
interiorly, and, placing it into the ring above mentioned, the
same operation is performed on the other side. The extremities
of the wires of the legs, and the end of the central wire
beyond the ring, are all twisted together with flat pincers,
and then bent towards the tail. The tail-bearer is next
formed, which consists of the fourth piece of wire, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
an oval is formed, by twisting the two ends two or three
turns, so that they may form a kind of fork, with the oval
nearly the length of the body of the bird; the two points of
the fork must be sharpened with a file, and near enough to
enable them to enter the rump, through which they must
pass, and their points will be concealed by the rectrices, or
large straight tail-feathers, while the oval is within the body
of the bird. If the bird is large, the tail-bearer must be
firmly attached to the interior wires, by twisting a small wire
several times round both. But unless the bird be large, it
may remain quite free.</p>

<p>All the parts of the skin at which we can come must be
thoroughly rubbed with preserving soap, the rump in particular,
which should, besides, be soaked with the solution of corrosive
sublimate. The stuffing is now proceeded with, by inserting
chopped flax or tow, till it has attained its proper dimensions.
The skin is brought together and sewed up, while
we take the greatest care to separate the feathers at every
stitch.</p>

<p>The orbits of the eyes are next finished, by inserting, with
small forceps and a short stuffing stick, a small quantity of
chopped cotton, while attention is paid to round the eyelids
properly. The glass eyes are now inserted, taking care to
place them properly under the eyelids. But, before fixing the
eye, a little calcareous cement must be used, to prevent them
from coming out. If any part of the nictitating membrane is
visible below, it must be pushed up with the steel point.</p>

<p>The stuffing of the bird being now completed, the next
thing is to place it either on a branch, or, if a bird which does
not sit on trees, on a piece of plank; whichever of these it is,
two holes are bored for the reception of the wires, which have
been allowed to protrude from the soles of the feet, for fixing
the bird (See fig 8.) These, of course, are pierced in such
situations as are necessary for the attitude or position of the
legs. The wires are put through these holes, and twisted so
as to secure the bird in its position. The attitude of the bird
will, of course, depend upon the fancy and taste of the operator,
and ought to be in conformity with the manners of the
birds in a living state.</p>

<p>The wire frame-work, above described, is the most simple
of any in its construction, and is better adapted for small
than large birds. Indeed, it will hardly suit those of the
larger species. The following is another method of constructing
the frame-work, which may be used either in large
or small birds:&mdash;</p>

<p>Like the former, it is constructed of four pieces of wire.
The center-piece should be double the length of the bird; it is
bent at a third of its length of an oval form, and twisted two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
turns, the shortest end being passed into the oval, and then
raised against the longer end, so as to produce a ring at the
end, outside of the oval, large enough to admit the two wires
which pass from the feet to the inside of the bird. It is now
twisted a second time, and firmly united to the longer end,
which ought to be straight, with a sharp point, effected by
means of a file. As before directed, it is rubbed with oil, and
forced through the stuffing of the neck. It ought to be so
constructed, by measurement, that the oval part of the wire
shall be in the center of the body inside. The wires of the
feet and legs, as before directed, ought to be straight and
pointed, and passed through the soles of the feet as before.
When the point has penetrated, the other end of the wire may
be bent, so that by means of it we may be able to assist in
forcing up the remainder of the wire. The two internal ends
of the foot-wires are twisted together, and curved within, so
as to pass through the small circle or ring of the middle
branch above the oval, to each side of which they are now attached
with a piece of small string.</p>

<p>The tail-bearer is constructed on the same principles, and
attached in the same manner, as before described, and the
latter apparatus is introduced after the neck and back are
finished in the stuffing.</p>

<p>This practice of introducing the neck-wire, after the neck
is stuffed, was first adopted at the Jardin des Plantes at
Paris, and is now invariably adopted in that establishment in
preference to introducing it before the neck is stuffed. The
neck of a swan or other long-necked and large birds, are
even done so. It is unquestionably the best plan which has
hitherto been discovered, as it preserves the cylindrical shape
of the neck.</p>

<h3>MR. BULLOCK&rsquo;S METHOD OF STUFFING BIRDS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Bullock, of the London Museum, Egyptian Hall, had another
method of arranging the wires, which, after what we
have already said, will be easily comprehended by a reference
to figure 8, where we have given a figure of his mode. After
the skin is taken off and prepared, different-sized, nealed, iron
wires are procured, according to the size of the bird they are
to support. The skin is laid on its back without stretching
it; cut two pieces of wire, the one rather longer than the bird
and the other shorter, so as not to reach to the head of the
bird; twist them together, sharpen the ends of the longer by
means of a file, and pass one end through the rump and the
other through the crown of the head, near the base of the
bill. Care must be taken not to extend the neck beyond its
ordinary length&mdash;a very common fault in most preservers.
Lay a little tow along the back of the skin for the wire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
rest on, then take two other pieces of strong wire and file
them to a point at one end; these are passed through the
soles of the feet and up the center of the leg-bone, or tarsus.
When within the body, they are to be fastened to the first
wires by twisting them together, which, when accomplished,
may be supposed to represent the backbone. The wire
should be left two or three inches out of the soles of the feet,
to fasten them in a standing position, as before directed.
Two smaller wires are then passed through the wings, as in
the legs, and afterwards fastened to the back-wires a little
higher up than the leg-wires, taking care that no part of the
skin is to be extended beyond its natural position.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Bullock&rsquo;s method of inserting the wires in setting up a bird.</i></p>
</div>

<h3>A NEW AND EASIER METHOD OF BIRD SKINNING AND STUFFING.</h3>

<p>A fair specimen being obtained, take common cotton wadding,
and with an ordinary paint-brush stick plug the throat,
nostrils, and, in large birds, the ears, with it, so that when
the skin is turned no juices may flow and spoil the feathers;
you must then provide yourself with the following articles:
A knife of this kind is very common; a pair of cutting pliers,
a pair of strong scissors, of a moderate size; a button-hook, a
marrow-spoon, and a hand-vise. With these, a needle and
thread and a sharpener of some kind, to give your knife an
occasional touch, you are prepared, so far as implements go.
Then provide yourself with annealed iron wire of various
sizes; some you may buy ready for use, some not; but you
can anneal it yourself by making it red hot in the fire, and
letting it cool in the air. Common hemp is the next article,
cotton wadding, pounded whitening, and pounded alum, or
chloride of lime; as to the poisons which are used, they will
be spoken of by and by. You should also have a common
brad-awl or two, and some pieces of quarter-inch pine whereon
to stand the specimens when preserved, if to be placed as
walking on a plane; if not, some small pieces of twigs or
small branches of trees should be kept ready for use, of various
sizes, according to the size of the bird; something of the form
of Fig. 9. Cedar, or common laurel cut in December, will be
found to answer best, but this must be regulated by fancy
and the requirements of the case; oak-boughs are sometimes
of a good shape.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 9.</i></p>
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="420" height="243" alt="" />
<p><i>Branch for mounting a bird.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The best time for preserving specimens is in spring, because
then the cock birds are in the best feather, and the weather
is not too warm. In mild weather three days is a good time
to keep a bird, as then the skin will part from the flesh easily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
If a specimen has bled much over the feathers, so as to
damage them, wash them carefully but thoroughly with warm
water and a sponge, and immediately cover them with pounded
whitening, which will adhere to them. Dry it as it hangs
upon them slowly before the fire, and then triturating the
hardened lumps gently between the fingers, the feathers will
come out almost as clean as ever. To test whether the specimen
is too decomposed to skin, try the feathers about the
auriculars, and just above the tail, and if they do not move
you may safely proceed.</p>

<p>Lay the bird on his back, and, parting the feathers from
the insertion of the neck to the tail, you will find in most
birds a spare space. Cut the skin the whole length of this,
and, passing the finger under it on either side, by laying hold
of one leg and bending it forward, you will be able to bring
the bare knee through the opening you have made; and with
your scissors cut it through at the joint; pull the shank still
adhering to the leg till the skin is turned back as far as it
will go: denude the bone of flesh and sinew, wrap a piece of
hemp round it, steeped in a strong solution of the pounded
alum, and then pull the leg by the claw, by which means the
skin will be brought again to its place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 10.</i></p>
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="215" height="201" alt="" /></div>

<p>After having served both legs alike, skin carefully round
the back, cutting off and leaving in the tail with that into
which the feathers grow, that is, the &ldquo;Pope&rsquo;s nose.&rdquo; Serve
the wing-bones the same as the leg, cutting them off close to
the body, and turn the skin inside out down to the head. The
back of the skull will then appear, and you will now find it of
advantage, as soon as you have got the legs and tail free, to
tie a piece of string round the body, and hang it up as a
butcher skins a sheep. Make in the back of the skull a cut
of the annexed form, with your knife, which you can turn
back like a trap-door, and with the marrow-spoon entirely
clear out the brains; A representing the neck, and B the
skin turned back. Having done this, wash the interior of the
skull thoroughly with the alum, and fill it with cotton wad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ding.
The next operation requires care and practice&mdash;namely,
to get out the eyes. This is done by cutting cautiously
until the lids appear, being careful not to cut the eye
itself, and you can then, with a forceps, which you will likewise
find useful, pull each from its socket; wipe the orifice
carefully, wash it with the alum solution, and fill it with cotton
wadding. Cut off the neck close to the skull, wash the
stump, and the whole of the interior of the skin with the
alum, and the <i>skinning</i> is done.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 11.</i></p>
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="468" height="128" alt="" />
<p><i>Wire bent for inserting.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Now comes the stuffing. The ordinary mode used by bird-preservers
is a simple one, and answers very well; there is a
French method, however, which has its advantages, and will
be adverted to hereafter. Take a piece of the wire suitable
to the size of the bird&mdash;that is, as large as the legs will carry&mdash;and
bend it into the following form, <i>a</i> representing the
neck, <i>b</i>, the body, and <i>c</i>, the junction of the tail, allowing
sufficient length of the neck for the wire to pass some distance
beyond the head, and being sharpened at each end,
which may be done by obliquely cutting it with the pliers.
Wind upon this wire hemp to the side of the bird&rsquo;s body,
which you should have lying by you to judge from, and it
will present something of this appearance. You can shape it
with the hand, but be careful not to make it the least <i>too
large</i>; and, after you have finished it to your satisfaction,
you may singe it, as the poulterer would singe a fowl, which
will make all neat; but be particular to wind the hemp very
tight. Then take the skin, lay it on the table on its back,
and pass the wire at the head into the marrow where the
neck is cut off, through above the roof of the mouth, and out
at one nostril, and draw it up close to the skull; turn the
skin back, and draw it down over the hemp body, and pass
the wire spike, protruding at the lower end, through the flesh
upon which the tail grows, about the center, and rather below
than above. The skin may now be adjusted to the hemp body,
and sewn up, beginning from the top of the breast, and
being particularly careful always to take the stitch from
<i>inside</i>, otherwise you will draw in the feathers at every pull.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
At first sew it very loose, and then, with the button-hook,
draw it together by degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 12.</i></p>
<img src="images/i010.jpg" width="349" height="190" alt="" />
<p><i>The hemp wound on the wire.</i></p>
</div>

<p>With the pliers cut two lengths of wire, long enough to
pass up the legs and into the neck, and leave something over
to fasten the bird by to the board or spray upon which it is to
be placed. The next operation requires some address and
great practice, namely, the passing the wire up the legs.
This is done by forcing it into the center of the foot, and
up the back of the legs, into the hemp body, through it obliquely,
and into the neck, until it is pretty firm.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 13.</i></p>
<img src="images/i011.jpg" width="210" height="261" alt="" /></div>

<p>In doing this, you must remember the ordinary position of
a bird when alive, and, therefore, instead of passing the wire
the whole way <i>within</i> the skin of the leg, when you get to
the part where you have cut off the bone&mdash;that is, the knee-joint&mdash;pass
it through the skin to the outside, where the
knee would come naturally in the attitude of standing or
perching&mdash;it makes little difference which. This is essential,
because, if the wire be passed the whole way <i>inside</i> the skin,
it produces a wrong placing of the legs. Fig 13 will illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>trate
this, <i>a</i> representing the line in which the wire should
run. The bird is now stuffed, and you may at once place it
upon a spray or board, as the case may be. In placing a
bird upon a spray, the first joint should be bent almost on a
level with the foot; and in placing a bird on a board, one
leg should be placed somewhat behind the other. If the
wings are intended to be closed, as is usually the case, bring
them into their place, which may be done by putting the fingers
under them, and pressing them together over the back;
you may then pass a needle, or large pin, of which you should
have a good supply by you, through the thick part of the
upper wing into the body, and so by the lower wing, and if
you allow these to protrude, you may fasten to one of them
a piece of thread, and wind it carefully and lightly round the
body, which will keep the feathers in their places, and this
thread should be kept on for a fortnight or three weeks, until
the bird is dry. The tail should be kept in its place, also, for
the same time, by a piece of thin wire bent over it, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 14.</i></p>
<img src="images/i012.jpg" width="143" height="32" alt="" /></div>

<p>The only thing now to do is to put in the eyes. The color,
of course, depends on the bird, and these you may buy at any
fishing-tackle store. If you do not use eyes too large, you
will find little difficulty; the juice of the lids will act as a sufficient
cement. As to the mounting, I shall say nothing about
that now, but shall only advert shortly to a French method of
preserving which is more difficult, but has the advantage of
superior firmness. It is this: Measuring from the insertion of
the neck to the tail, make a wire frame of this form, the
measure taken being from <span class="small">A.</span> to <span class="small">B.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 15.</i></p>
<img src="images/i013.jpg" width="379" height="69" alt="" />
<p><i>Wire Used in French Method.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Upon this end wind hemp for the neck only, and place in
the skin in the same way as before directed, only that, instead
of one wire being passed through that in which the tail grows,
it is a fork that is passed through it. Having formed this
frame, fit on to it two legs, thus: and after the frame itself is
in the skin, pass these from the <i>inside</i> down each leg, instead
of from the outside, and fasten them on to the frame with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
pliers, by twisting the ends, <span class="small">B B</span>, round the frame, <span class="small">C</span>, in the
first figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 16.</i></p>
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="277" height="309" alt="" />
<p><i>The Wire Legs.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This will make all firm, and you can then fill the body with
cut hemp and sew up. One word as to the other preparations
used by bird preservers. These are either corrosive
sublimate or regulus of arsenic, which is yellow and of a consistence
like butter. As I have said before, in cold weather,
when there are no flies about, alum will do perfectly well; in
warm weather either of the two others may be used. I should
prefer the former&mdash;corrosive sublimate&mdash;as the other is &ldquo;messy,&rdquo;
and the chief object is to dry up anything which can be
attacked by flesh-seeking insects. When you have finished
your bird you can lay the feathers with a large needle&mdash;it is
as well to have one fixed in a handle and kept for this purpose&mdash;and,
tying the two mandibles of the bill together with
a piece of thread until the whole specimen has hardened and
dried, the work is done.</p>

THE ART OF MOUNTING BIRDS, DRIED SKINS, FEATHERS, ETC.</h2>

<h3>MOUNTING IN GENERAL.</h3>

<p>We will suppose that a proficiency, from practice, has been
attained in the art of bird-preserving, according to the instructions
given. The proficiency in preserving may apply
only to the preservation and the form, great and necessary
things, no doubt, as preliminaries; but, like matter without
manner, of little avail alone. For attitude, I would say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
as has been said to many a young artist, go to Nature, and
there you will find an original in perfection. Would you
make a willow-wren look like a willow-wren, watch him as he
there hangs upon the weeping birch, or stands on a bough
peering in quest of food. Each bird has its own manner, and
if you cannot hit the manner, or make your stuffed skin so
far amenable as to assume the attitude, it is either ill-stuffed,
or you want the requisite knowledge of that which you should
copy.</p>

<h3>BIRD PINNED UP.</h3>

<p>Having fixed on the attitude, it now only remains to put
the feathers into their natural order as smoothly and regularly
as possible; and to keep them in this state they should
be bound around with small fillets of muslin fastened with
pins as represented in fig. 17. The bird should then be
thoroughly dried, by placing it in an airy situation, if in Summer;
or if in Winter, near the fire, but not so close as to affect
the natural oil contained in the feathers. The want of proper
attention in drying ruins many a fine specimen; if long kept
damp putridity ensues despite all preservatives, when the
skin will become rotten, and the feathers will soon fall off;
besides, the mold and long-continued damp change the
chemical properties of the preservatives used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p><i>Fig. 17.</i></p>
<img src="images/i015.jpg" width="268" height="249" alt="" /></div>

<p>After the bird has been thoroughly dried, the fillets are removed;
the wire which protruded from the head is cut off as
close to the skull as possible, with the wire cutting pincers
elsewhere shown. It must then be attached to a circular, or
other shaped piece of wood, with the generic and specific
name and sex, as well as its country and locality attached to
it, on a small ticket, when it may be placed in a museum.</p>

<p>Young hands commonly suppose that a bird should stand bolt
upright, with the legs almost perpendicular, or at right-angles
to the perch. This is a great mistake, and never to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
in Nature. Do <i>we</i> stand rigid, like a foot-soldier on drill?
Does not a bird, as well as ourselves, accommodate itself to
the thing on which it rests? Assuredly it does; for birds
do not, as a young bird-stuffer endeavors to do, find always a
perch to rest upon in the plane of the horizon. It therefore
follows that, as he keeps himself upright, his legs must accommodate
themselves to his perch. So in the ground-birds
there is a gentle slope backwards from the hind toe, the balance
being preserved in both cases by throwing the body forward
in proportion. It is not uncommon to see birds preserved
with wings and tail spread. Now, ordinarily speaking,
this is very objectionable, because very unnatural.</p>

</div>
<p><i>Proper positions of birds.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A bird preserved is supposed to represent a bird in a state
of repose; that is, not in flight; the only modification allowable
being with regard to those birds whose manner it may
be to have the wings more or less open on occasions; thus
the falcon tribe, supposing they are represented as devouring
a quarry, or two birds toying with each other. It may be
that a bird essentially aerial, like the swift, or perhaps some
of the terns or the frigate bird, may be represented as actually
on the wing. In this case, of course, the wings must be
spread; and this is best done by passing a wire, not too
thick, from the base of the quill-feathers on the under side
alongside the bone into the body, where it should be carefully
and coaxingly inserted towards the tail until you feel that you
have a pretty good hold. You may then pass it carefully
under the longest quill-feather, and through the back of the
case, and fasten it by bringing it back again through and
clinching it, concealing it so by the oblique position of the
bird that it is not detectable. It is obvious that by passing
the wire alongside the bone, you may bend the wings to any
angle you please.</p>

<p>With regard to the case, there are two methods; one a bell-glass,
which, glass being now so reasonable, is certainly a
very pretty and reasonable way of mounting, but inapplicable
to birds which are to be placed on a wall, or to be represented
flying; although this may be managed by attaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
one wire from the point of the wing to a twig sufficiently
firm, which it will scarcely appear to touch, if managed
adroitly. It is likewise indispensable that a bird for a shade
should be stuffed so well as to look nicely in all positions.
One thing must always be remembered, <i>do not have your case
a shade too large</i>, just clear the object so as not to stint it for
room; and in flat cases this applies chiefly to depth, for it
should have sufficient light, or it will not look well. Wooden
cases should be made as slight (in thickness) as is consistent
with firmness; well-seasoned white deal is best; and the case
should be formed of back, top and bottom, open at the front
and sides, and at each corner of the front two slight deal supports,
rabbited on their inner edges, and presenting on the
whole this appearance.</p>

<p>Having the case prepared, it should be papered with ordinary
demy paper on the top and back within, and, when
the paste is dry, washed over carefully with size and whitening,
tinted with a little stone-blue; some add some touches of
white subsequently to represent clouds, the ground representing
the air; some also paste a landscape on the back, but
this must be good, or you had better have plain color. The
bird to be placed in this case is either perching, standing or
flying. For the latter, directions have been given. As to the
two former, the perch must be firmly fixed in the small piece
of flat wood upon which it previously stood, and put in upon
it, the wood being fastened to the bottom of the case, either by
screwing from below, from above, or gluing with stout glue,
or by passing wire through two holes in the bottom of the
case and the wood, and clinching above. In this case, or in
screwing from below, let the wire or the screw into the wood,
and putty over, and so if the bird is represented standing. The
bird being fixed, the next thing is the decorating or &ldquo;weeding,&rdquo;
as it is technically called, and here we enter upon a subject
so entirely of taste and fancy, that no fixed rules, as
to the disposition, can in all cases be given. One rule applies
equally to this as to landscape painting, viz., that there
should always be a compensation of objects. That is, if you
have a turf of grass on one side which rises towards the top
of the case, there should be something in the lower opposite
corner to strike the eye, but not to rise above midway at
furthest, and the ground, or floor, should not be over-furnished
with moss, etc. After the bird is fixed, the whole bottom
should be carefully glued over with thin glue, taking care,
where the bird&rsquo;s feet are at the bottom, not to touch the toes
with the glue. Some fine-sifted sand or gravel should then
be sifted over it, and it will adhere wherever the glue has
touched; for this purpose a small tin shovel is best, something
in this form, and about two inches wide by four long, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
handle in proportion, which can be made to order at any tin-man&rsquo;s
for a trifle.</p>

<p>Everything used in &ldquo;weeding&rdquo; should be baked in a slow
oven, otherwise spiders&rsquo; eggs and minute creatures, which
are pretty sure to be contained in it, will make their appearance
after the case is closed in the disagreeable form of destroying
your specimen. Moss, etc., by being slowly dried,
will also keep its color better. Yellow moss, found on the
roofs of old barns, and dark gray of the same species, are
very generally useful: and where yellow moss cannot be had,
the white or gray may be colored with chrome, and looks as
well. Water-plants fade, being more or less succulent, and
hence a little common water-color with gum will be used with
advantage and look less artificial than oil paint, which is often
used. Fern looks very pretty as an adjunct for heath-birds,
but it should be dried gradually and carefully, when <i>quite</i> full
grown, and a small touch of light green, permanent white
forming a portion of it, will give it a freshness and more natural
appearance. Grass in seed (not in flower) of various
kinds is also a very pretty addition; but bird preservers have
a habit of using dyed grass, and yellow and red <i>Xeranthymum</i>,
or Everlasting, which is certainly to be avoided, and
indeed anything which is unnatural. If it is wished to introduce
a lump of earth, or an apparent bank, a piece of thick
brown paper, bent to the requisite shape, and glued over and
covered with sifted sand or gravel, has a very good effect;
but insects and butterflies, or artificial flowers, unless they
are extremely natural, should certainly be avoided. Regard
should also be had to the season at which the bird is usually
seen.</p>

<p>For instance, Summer birds are, of course, surrounded by
green and living objects, but Autumn or Winter visitants by
decaying or dead herbage. It has often been made an experiment
to represent snow, but it is difficult to obtain anything
white enough, and at the same time of a crystalline
character, which, of course, it should be. Potato farina nicely
dried, mixed with Epsom salts pounded very fine, does not
make a bad substitute; but the real difficulty lies behind,
namely, in fixing it, and, more than all, the least damp takes
very much from its appearance, if it does not destroy the
effect, and hence we must have recourse to mineral aid, and
any very white mineral powder mingled with pounded glass
is perhaps best. It is unnecessary to say that the herbage
upon which it is meant to rest should be touched all over with
paste, not glue, and the white mixture shaken over and left
to dry. What will heighten the effect very much, if prettily
executed, is a black landscape with a dark leaden sky and
nearly black earth mingled with moss. To represent water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
a small piece of looking-glass, surrounded with moss, etc.,
answers very well. The bills and legs of birds should be always
varnished, and where the natural color fades after death
it should be restored by a thin coat of oil-color of the required
shade. The bird being fixed and the case garnished, nothing
remains but to put in the glass; this is in three pieces, one
for the front and a piece at each end. This can be pasted in
with very strong paper round the edge, advancing sufficiently
over the glass to hold it. In doing this it is not necessary to
be very particular to avoid pasting the glass, as after it is
dried it can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. The last
operation is a very simple one, and done in a few minutes.
You must procure some black spirit-varnish, which you can
make yourself by dissolving the best black sealing-wax in
spirits of wine, and should be kept corked; when this is good
it acts as paint and varnish at the same time, and dries as
fast as it is put on. One or two brass rings screwed on at
the top of the back of the case will finish the bird, and if the
case be nicely and closely made, there is no limit of time to
which the preservation of the specimen may not extend.</p>

<h3>METHOD OF MOUNTING DRIED SKINS.</h3>

<p>We must now say something respecting the setting up of
skins which have been preserved by travelers, and sent home
from distant parts.</p>

<p>The general method is exactly the same as in stuffing recent
specimens. There are, however, some preliminary steps
which it is necessary to know.</p>

<p>If the specimen sent home has been partially stuffed, our
first business is to undo the stitches, if it has been sewed&mdash;which
was an unnecessary process. We then remove the
whole cotton or tow from the inside, by the assistance of
forceps, and from the neck with a small piece of wire, twisted
or hooked at the end. Having finished this, small balls of
wet cotton are placed in the orbits of the eyes, and the legs
and feet are wrapped round with wet cotton or linen rags.
A <i>damp</i> cloth is then thrown over the bird, and it is allowed
to remain in this state till next day. The neck and body are
then filled with wet linen or cotton, and it will be ready for
commencing setting up in four or five hours.</p>

<p>The eyes are now put in, as directed in the recent subjects,
and then stuffed in exactly the same manner. Some difficulty
will, however, be experienced with respect to the leg-wires,
and it will require more time and care, from the dryness of
the legs, to get the wire to penetrate. Having proceeded so
far as to get the bird generally formed, the wings are next adjusted;
this also is frequently difficult, owing to the stiffness
of the tendons and want of proper attention in skinning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
drying them at first. Indeed, with some of the South American
birds, a proper adjustment of the wings is found impracticable,
owing to the attempts of the native Indians of
Guyana, who seldom dispose them properly.</p>

<p>When these skins&mdash;frequently exceedingly valuable from
their rarity&mdash;are undone, to be remounted, it is oftentimes
found utterly impossible to get the wings to take a natural
set, in which case there is no other remedy but cutting them
off close to the body, and fixing them anew. The scapulars
are separated, they are softened with damp cloths, and then
wrapped up with bands of sheet lead, to give them a proper
set. When we have got them in their natural shape, they
must be fixed to the sides by cement and cotton, and a long
pin through each, with the head concealed amongst the
feathers. The scapulars, which we have cut off, must then
be cemented on, and they will effectually cover the joining of
the wings. The bird being now arranged, and all the feathers
adjusted, it is wrapped round with small bands of fine linen
or muslin, and set aside till thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>Should any feathers be disengaged during the mounting,
they must be kept, and, when the bird is dry, we can replace
them in their proper situations with a pair of forceps, after
they have been touched on their shafts with the cement; the
feathers around the place in which we intend to insert them
must be held up with the probing-needle.</p>

<p>If any of the feathers are deranged in mounting, and have
got a wrong set, the only way to remedy the defect is to pull
them out with forceps, and re-insert them with cement.</p>

<h3>OF MOUNTING BIRDS, FEATHER BY FEATHER.</h3>

<p>Rare birds are frequently received from foreign countries,
the skins of which are in such a state of decay, that it is impossible
to mount them by the ordinary process above described.
The only way in which they can be preserved, is to
mount them feather by feather, which, however, is a very
tedious method. It is as follows:</p>

<p>Procure a piece of soft pliable wire, such as is used by bell-hangers;
or take some of the ordinary wire used, and make
it red-hot in the fire, and allow it to cool gradually, when it
will become quite pliable. Take five pieces of this, of different
lengths, and form them into the skeleton of a body;
namely, two for the back, one on each side, and one to represent
the breast-bone. Imitate the shape of the bird&rsquo;s body as
nearly as possible. The wires must be roughened with a file,
at the place where all the wires meet, at the neck and rump;
and first wrap the place next the neck round with strong
thread or fine brass wire. Two pieces intended for the back
must bend gently downwards, and be gradually separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
from each other towards the center, and brought together
again at the place intended for the rump, whither they must
intersect each other, and be twisted two or three times, to
keep them in their place; they are then spread out as supports
for the tail; the side-pieces are next formed, so as to
represent the natural bulge of a bird&rsquo;s body, and attached to
the rump; the piece representing the breast is then formed,
joined at the rump, and afterwards continued as long as the
other tail-pieces, to support the center of the tail; while at
the front extremity a piece is left, for the purpose of forming
a neck to which to attach the head. Two leg-wires are
attached to the side-wires, being rolled round them for several
turns, making a frame-work the shape of the bird.</p>

<p>After this body has been properly formed, it must be
wrapped round with tow-sliver, and the neck thickened to its
required dimensions. When this is accomplished, the head,
legs, wings and tail are softened in the usual manner; the
eyes are then fixed in with some cotton introduced into the
orbits, with a little of the cement. The wings and tail are
now placed on a table, with a flat leaden weight above each,
to restore them to their natural shape. The leg-wires are
then passed through the legs, commencing at the top, and
bringing them out at the soles of the feet, and left with a
piece extending beyond the claws.</p>

<p>The tail is now fixed on, by first attaching to it a quantity
of cotton with the cement, and, when dry, it is fixed to the
part intended as the rump.</p>

<p>The feet of the bird must be fixed into a piece of wood, as a
perch, the ends of which must be left some inches beyond the
body. The end next to the tail is fixed into a table-vise, with
the belly upwards, and the head pointing toward the operator.
The feathers are now put on, commencing under the tail, or
crissum, with what are termed the under-tail coverts; a coating
of cement must be previously laid on, to attach the feathers
with. It is proceeded with upwards to the breast, and finally
the length of the neck, taking care to put the proper feathers on
their respective sides, as the side-feathers have all an inclination
to one side. The bird is now turned with the back up,
still keeping the head towards the stuffer; and the wings are
fixed on with cement, and pins forced through the beards of
the feathers to conceal the heads. When this is done put on
the feathers of the rump, and proceed upwards, as has been
done with the belly. After reaching the top of the neck, the
head is then fixed on with some cotton immersed in the cement,
and allowed to dry before attempting to put on the
feathers.</p>

<p>In this mode of mounting a bird there are several things
which must be attentively adhered to; these are&mdash;first, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
put the feathers too thick, for there is a danger of running
short; secondly, all the shafts of the feathers must have a
small bit cut off the tip, so as to admit the cement and to
give them a firmer hold; and thirdly, that the feathers should
all occupy their respective parts; and fourthly, that they
should be arranged as they are in nature on these parts, as
the disposition of every part of the body is peculiar to itself.</p>

<p>At first, this mode of setting up birds will be found a difficult
task, but, by a little practice and experience, it will
become familiar and comparatively easy, although it will
always be found a tedious process. We have seen some
specimens set up in this way, which we could hardly detect
from those mounted in the ordinary manner.</p>

<p>Besides what we have already said concerning the stuffing
and preparing of birds, there are many details connected
with particular species which demand our attention, and which
can only be described as regarding that species. It will,
however, be impossible for us to enter into all these minutely,
but only give a few examples as general guides. We shall
take these in systematic succession.</p>

<h3>PRESERVATION OF COLORS.</h3>

<p>In the preservation of the feathers of Birds, little else is
required to prevent the dissipation of their colors than to
keep them as much as possible from air and light. These
two agents, which were indispensable to their beauty and perfection
in a living state, now exercise their influence as destroyers,
and that influence will sooner or later work its ends
according to the quality, texture, or color of the object with
which it is contending. The feathers are now deprived of
two agents, which in a living state contributed to their vigor
and their beauty, namely, the internal circulating juices
which they received from the body of the animal, and the
external application of oil by the bill of the bird, supplied
from a gland which is placed over the rump of all birds.</p>

<p>The colors of the rapacious tribes are not so evanescent as
those of many others, as they, for the most part are composed
of intense browns and blacks, which are not so easily
absorbed by light or air, so that they continue for a very long
period without any sensible difference. There are, however,
certain other points which are liable to almost immediate
change of color after the death of the animals, and these are
the cere and skin of the legs and feet, and the naked skin on
the heads and necks of Vultures and their congeners. We
shall treat of these individually.</p>

<p>Now, as all these colors which we have described are liable
to change, immediately after death, it is evident that considerable
nicety will be required to give the preserved specimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the appearance of nature. These must, therefore, be supplied
artificially with the varnish colors, which we have particularly
described in their proper place, as also the combinations
for the formation of compound colors. The reddish-brown
color mentioned, of which the fold is composed, must be
touched by a mixture of the scarlet varnish, with a little
powdered burnt umber, and the blue streaks with which it is
traversed, colored above with cobalt blue. All the varnish
colors have a tendency to shine, which, it will be evident, is
not the character of any part of the skin, or caruncle of the
bird described. As soon, therefore, as it is thoroughly dry,
which will be in about an hour, the whole surface must be
gently rubbed with very fine sand-paper, which will completely
remove the gloss and give the appearance of nature.</p>

<p>Some nicety will be required in painting betwixt the hairs,
but it can be easily managed with a little caution. Sometimes
these hairs are liable to become brown, in which case
they can be touched with the black varnish.</p>

<p>As these birds are inhabitants of warm climates, some care
is requisite, after killing them, to prevent decay; the tendons
of the legs should be extracted to prevent their being attacked
by moths, and their place supplied by some cotton and preservatives.
The tendons are extracted by means of a longitudinal
incision made behind the tarsus. The edges of this
incision can easily be brought together when the bird is under
the process of preparation.</p>

COLLECTING AND PRESERVING BIRDS&rsquo; EGGS AND NESTS.</h2>

<p>Few objects of Natural History are more interesting than
the nests of birds. To the reflecting naturalist, they open up
a wide field for inquiry. Speaking of the examination of
birds, in the exercise of their mechanical arts of constructing
nests, Professor Rennie says: &ldquo;This work is the business of
their lives&mdash;the duty which calls forth that wonderful ingenuity
which no experience can teach, and which no human skill can
rival. The infinite variety of modes in which the nests of
birds are constructed, and the exquisite adaptation of the nest
to the peculiar habits of the individual, offer a subject of
almost exhaustless interest.&rdquo; The number and variety of the
eggs of birds are curious subjects of contemplation, and should
be carefully noted whenever opportunity offers. They are as
essential to the personal history of the species as any other
part of our inquiries.</p>

<p>The eggs are emptied of their contents by making a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
small hole at each end with a point. By blowing at one of
the ends, the contents will escape by the other, unless the
young has been already formed; in which case a larger hole
must be made in the side of the egg, and the contents removed
with a small hook. The hole should then be stopped up
by pasting a little gold-beater&rsquo;s leaf over it. The eggs are
then either returned to their nest, in which they ought to be
cemented, or should be fixed down by one side to cards, with
the name and locality attached.</p>

<p>The best manner of conveying loose eggs to a distance is
to put some cotton at the bottom of the nest, and then another
layer above them. The nests should all be put up in
separate boxes, if possible, and so packed that the pressure
of the lid may not injure the eggs, or a box with several
compartments should be used, taking care that each is carefully
marked. It would also be of consequence to have the
nests attached to the branches, with those species which
build on trees, which will enable us to trace the ingenious
means employed by those little animals in constructing
their habitations. In sending home specimens from a
foreign country, the seams of the box should be covered
by pitched cloth, to protect them from the influence of
moisture.</p>

<p>To preserve the shells of eggs, first take care to clear them
of their contents; get a small, fine-pointed common syringe,
such as is sold in toy-shops, and inject the specimen with
water until it comes out quite clean. When an egg has been
partly hatched or addled, the removal of the contents generally
includes that of the internal membrane or pellicle: this
makes the shell weaker. When the specimens are quite
clean internally, and have become dry (which will be in a day
or two), take the syringe and inject them with a strong solution
of isinglass (with a little sugar-candy added to prevent
its cracking); blow this out again whilst warm. Let the
shell get dry, and then wash the outside with a soft wet
cloth to remove saline particles, dirt from the nest, etc.
This method varnishes the inside, and the first specimen on
which it has been tried was the before-mentioned hedge-accentor&rsquo;s
egg, which is to this day as bright in color as a
fresh specimen.</p>

<p>Also in a pair of nightjar&rsquo;s eggs, of which species the delicate
gray tint is particularly evanescent, one was injected in
the manner described, and the other was not; in the first the
gray is still perfectly defined, in the other it has entirely disappeared.
Eggs which have lost their internal pellicle become
strengthened by this process, and those which have not
lost their color greatly improved.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
SKINNING, PRESERVING, AND SETTING UP REPTILES, FISHES AND
MOLLUSCOUS ANIMALS, ETC.</h2>

<h3>TORTOISES AND TURTLES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Skinning.</span>&mdash;The first operation is to separate the back and
breast-shells with a strong short knife or chisel. If the force
of the hand is inadequate, a mallet may be used, taking care
not to strike so hard as to crack the shell.</p>

<p>These two bony plates being covered by the skin, or by
scales, the scapula, and all the muscles of the arm and neck,
in place of being attached to the ribs and spine, are placed
below, from which cause the tortoise has been termed a
retroverted animal. The vertebral extremity of the scapula
is articulated with the shield, and the opposite extremity of
the clavicle with the breast-plate in such a manner that the
shoulders form a ring for the passage of the windpipe and
gullet.</p>

<p>After the turtle is opened, all the flesh which adheres to the
breast-plate, and also to the upper shell, is removed, while
attention is paid to the parts as above described. The head,
fore-feet, and tail are skinned as in quadrupeds; but none of
these must be removed from the upper shell, but left attached.</p>

<p>All the fleshy parts being removed, the shells are washed
out with a sponge, and carefully dried. They are then slightly
rubbed with the arsenical soap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stuffing.</span>&mdash;Wires are now passed through the middle of
the legs, after the skin has been rubbed with the preservative.
The skull is returned to its place, and the whole of the head,
neck, and legs stuffed with chopped flax or tow. The parts
of the skin which have been cut are then sewed together.
The back and breast-plates are then united by four small
holes, being bored at their edges, and united by strings or
small wires. The junction of the bones may then be attached
with the cement, colored so as to correspond with the shell.</p>

<p>If the calipash is dirty, it may be cleaned with a slight solution
of nitric acid and water; afterwards cleanly washed,
oiled, and then rubbed with a woolen rag, to give it a polish.</p>

<h3>CROCODILES AND LIZARDS IN GENERAL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Skinning.</span>&mdash;All this tribe are skinned in the same manner
as quadrupeds. Care, however, is required in skinning the
tails of the smaller species, as they are very liable to break.
The skins being of a dry nature, require but little of the preservative.
After they are thoroughly dried they will keep a
very long time without decay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stuffing.</span>&mdash;Stuff them as directed for quadrupeds. They
admit of but little variety of attitude. The small species are
exceedingly apt to change color in drying; which must be imitated
with the colored varnishes, and afterwards dimmed
with sand-paper. To keep them in their natural colors, they
should be preserved in spirits.</p>

<p>The skins of such as are glossy should be varnished after
they are perfectly dry.</p>

<h3>SERPENTS IN GENERAL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Skinning.</span>&mdash;In skinning serpents there is some nicety required,
to cut them so as not to disfigure the scales; the
opening should be made in the side, commencing at the termination
of the scales; and they should on no account be
divided, as upon their number the species is mostly determined.</p>

<p>It is a very frequent practice to send home serpents without
the head, which renders them quite unfit for any scientific
purpose. This proceeds from the fear of receiving poison
from the fangs. But there is not the slightest danger of being
affected, as these can easily be cut out by means of pincers.
The head should be cleaned and the brain removed, in the
same manner as recommended for birds and quadrupeds, the
skull anointed and then returned into the skin.</p>

<p>When the skin is removed, it may be rolled up and packed
in small space. The simplest way to preserve small species is
to put them in spirits, which must not be too strong, as it
will destroy the colors.</p>

<p>Mr. Burchell, in his four years&rsquo; journey through Africa,
glued the skins of the smaller serpents perfectly flat on paper,
which preserved the size of the animal, and the skin retained
all the beauty of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stuffing.</span>&mdash;The skin, if not recent, must be first softened
in the manner recommended for birds. A piece of wire is
taken, the length of the animal, which must be wrapped
round with tow till it is of a proper thickness, and above the
whole a spiral band of sliver should be carefully wrapped. It
is then placed inside of the skin, and sewed up. The eyes
are placed in as directed for quadrupeds and birds. When
dry, give the serpent a coat of varnish, and then twist it into
any attitude wished. A favorite and striking one is to have
it wound round some animal, and in the act of killing it.</p>

<h3>FROGS AND TOADS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Skinning.</span>&mdash;The mouth is opened, and the first vertebræ of
the neck is cut. The whole inside of the mouth is cut out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
with scissors. The two jaws are next raised up, and the skin
is pushed back with the fingers of the right hand, while the
body is drawn back in a contrary direction with the other
hand, and the whole body is then drawn out at the mouth.
The legs are then returned to their proper place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stuffing.</span>&mdash;The simplest method of stuffing these animals
is with sand. A small funnel is placed in the mouth, and
pour in well-dried sand. When full, a small piece of cotton
is pushed into the throat, with some of the cement, to keep
the sand from escaping on moving the animal.</p>

<p>The Frog is then placed on a board, and in an attitude.
When quite dry, give it a coat of varnish. When this has
perfectly dried, very small perforations are made under the
belly with the point of a needle, and the sand allowed to escape,
leaving the body in its natural form.</p>

<p>These animals are liable to change of color from drying,
and should, therefore, be painted with the varnish to their
natural hues. There is less difficulty with Toads in this respect,
as they are usually of a brown color, and not liable to
much change.</p>

<p>They may be perfectly preserved in spirits.</p>

<h3>FISHES.</h3>

<p>The best method of securing the scales and colors of Fish,
is, as soon as they are caught, to apply cambric or tissue
paper to them, which will soon dry and adhere firmly; the
body may be then taken out and the skin dried. When the
skin is to be stuffed, roll it in a moist cloth, which will not
only render it pliable, but also soften the tissue paper, so as
it can be removed, when the colors will be found to be much
brighter than by any other method with which we are yet acquainted.</p>

<h4>LAMPREYS, EELS, AND OTHER FISH OF SIMILAR FORM.</h4>

<p>These species may be skinned in the same manner as Frogs
and Toads, by drawing the body through the mouth.</p>

<h4>OF SKINNING FISH IN GENERAL.</h4>

<p>The fish should be procured as fresh as possible, more particularly
if it is one of those on which the scales are loosely
attached. Lay it on one side and cut the gills with a pair of
scissors; then introduce a little tow or piece of sponge into
the place to prevent the blood from flowing during the process
of skinning; let the fins be raised and gently extended,
and two pieces of paper, something the shape of each, be
placed under them, only extending a little beyond them.
Coat the paper with a weak solution of gum-arabic, and put
a piece of similar size on the top of the fin; by pressing these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
gently they will adhere and dry in a few minutes; these will
keep the fins extended, and preserve them during the operation
of stuffing. When these are dry, take a piece of tissue
paper or thin silk, and press it gently on one side of the fish.
The natural glutinous matter which covers the scales will be
sufficient to make it adhere firmly; it will soon dry and form
a strong protection to the scales during the skinning. Without
this precaution the skin could not be removed from mullet,
sea beaver, etc., without the scales being much disfigured,
and losing many of them. Indeed, in such fishes, it is not
amiss to put on an additional coating of paper with gum-water.
This will not only secure the scales, but will also assist
in keeping the proper form of the fish, by preventing distention.</p>

<p>When these papers are thoroughly dry, turn the fish on a
soft cloth, with the uncovered side upwards, and open it with
sharp scissors from the bottom of the tail-fin to nearly the
point of the snout, keeping as correctly on the lateral line as
possible, which can be seen in most fishes. The cheek should
be afterwards cut open, so that the flesh may be removed
from it; cut also the flesh from the opposite cheek, and
supply its place by cotton. The skin must now be detached
from the flesh, which will require some care at first. It must
be commenced at the head, and separating it downwards
with the assistance of a knife, and the fin-bones must be cut
through with scissors. The spine must now be cut through
close to the head, and also at the tail, and the body removed.</p>

<p>All the animal matter having been completely removed
from the skin, the inside must be wiped dry, and the preservative
applied in the same manner as directed for birds and
quadrupeds. Great care is necessary to prevent it from being
too much distended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Sharks</span> and <span class="smcap">Large Fishes</span>, an incision is made below
the head, and extended to the fin of the tail; the skin is then
separated on each side with a scalpel, cutting back as far as
possible, so that the vertebræ may be cut close to the head.
The tail is then skinned. The head is pushed inwards, and
the skin passed over it above, and all the cartilage cut carefully
away. Care must be taken not to enlarge the branchial
openings too much, which would render it necessary to
sew them up again, and it is not easy to hide a seam in a fish&rsquo;s
skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diadon</span>, <span class="smcap">Tetradon</span>, and <span class="smcap">Balistes</span>, and their congeners, are
opened by the belly. The ostracion is enveloped in a skin,
which consists of a single piece, the tail of which only is free
and flexible. The opening in the belly must not be large;
the tail must be opened, the flesh cut away, and stuffed with
cotton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h4>STUFFING.</h4>

<p>The skins, being properly anointed, are filled with tow or
cotton. This must be so managed that there will be no
prominences on the outside of the skin, which in fishes, is
smooth and even for the most part. When properly filled,
they must be sewed up, and set aside to dry in the air, but
not exposed to the rays of the sun. In a few days, the papers
with which the fins were extended are taken off, by damping
them with a sponge. The glass eyes are now introduced, after
filling the orbits with cotton and a little cement to secure them
in their places. The skins may then be coated with turpentine
varnish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sharks.</span>&mdash;In stuffing these large fishes, it is necessary to
use a stick for a center support. This must also enter the
head, through the opening of the throat. If it is intended that
the specimen shall be suspended from the ceiling, wire-hooks
must be fastened into the wood. From these must be placed
upright wires, so that they penetrate the skin, and pass
through the back. Let the whole internal surface of the skin
be well rubbed with the preservative. The body is then
stuffed to its full size, and afterwards sewed up. The stuffing
of the head must be completed through the orbits of the eyes,
and also by the mouth. This finished, the glass eyes are inserted,
as in other animals, and fixed by means of cement.</p>

<p>Many species of fish have semi-transparent cartilages connected
with the eyes. These must be imitated with gum-arabic
and powdered starch, as well as the cornea of the eyes.</p>

<p>The skins of all fish, which are similar to that of sharks,
must be well supplied with spirits of turpentine, after they
are mounted, more particularly the head and fins; but as they
are not glossy, they do not require to be varnished.</p>

<p>When the fins are strong, it is necessary to keep them
extended by means of a wire introduced through them.</p>

<p>In the Diadons, the chief thing to be attended to, beyond
what we have stated, is, to take care that the spines, with
which their skins are beset, are not broken or depressed in
any way.</p>

<p>Salmon, Trout, Tench, Carp, Pike, etc., are very easily preserved,
as the scales are firmly attached to the skin; and
although they become somewhat dim from drying, their
colors and brilliancy are considerably restored by means of
varnish, if applied before they are thoroughly dried.</p>

<p>After a lapse of time, the varnish will rise into little scales;
to remove these, nitric acid, diluted in water, must be applied
to the whole external surface, which has the effect of completely
taking off the varnish, or at least of raising it from
the skin, which, when allowed to dry, can be wholly removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
by rubbing it with a small brush. It may then be varnished
again; when dry, it will ever afterwards continue quite solid.</p>

<p>What is above recommended will apply to almost all fishes.</p>

<h4>LOBSTERS, CRABS, ETC.</h4>

<p>In this class are included crabs, lobsters, and their congeners.
These animals are all protected by a coriaceous covering,
or shell, which is easily preserved, although there is
considerable difficulty in preserving the colors of some species.</p>

<p>The flesh must be extracted from the large claws of lobsters
and crabs by breaking the smallest possible piece from
their points and introducing a small, crooked wire; in the
smaller claws the flesh must be allowed to dry, and to facilitate
this extremely small perforations should be made in opposite
sides of the shell by means of a sharp, triangular awl,
so as to allow the air to pass through it.</p>

<p>In lobsters the branchiæ and all the intestines must be cut
away; the latter is effected by separating the body from the
lower parts, and then extracting the internal parts with any
sharp instrument; it should then be dried and cemented together,
after being well anointed with the preservative. In
crabs, the body, with all the limbs attached, is pulled separate
from the back shell and the whole fleshy matter carefully
picked out and preserving powder and the solution of corrosive
sublimate applied to the different internal parts. In
drying lobsters, crabs, etc., they should be exposed to a free
current of air, but not to the sun&rsquo;s rays, as it reddens the
shells of crustaceous animals.</p>

<p>It need hardly be mentioned, that before applying the preservatives,
the shells should be well washed with cold water.</p>

<p>The Hermit-Crab always takes possession of the shell of
some turbinated Univalve as its domicile. These are easily
preserved by pulling out the animal after it is dead. An incision
is made in the soft tail of the animal, and the contents
allowed to run off; it is then filled with cotton and imbued
with the preservative; some cement is then put on the tail
and the animal returned to its shell, which completes the
operation of preserving.</p>

<p>In sending home crustaceous animals, the larger species
should be emptied of their fleshy matter, which, however, is
not necessary with the smaller species; they should be packed
in middling-sized cases, and each wrapped in separate
papers, with a thick bed of cotton or flax between each. In
Lobsters, and the species which are allied to them, great care
must be exercised in preserving the tentacula or feelers
which emanate from their heads, as these become very brittle
after they are dried. In proceeding to set up specimens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
which have been sent home, they should be immersed in <i>cold</i>
water for some time, to give pliability to the tentacula and
other parts, without which it will be impossible to set them up
in any way without their breaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Bullock recommended that Crabs and all other crustaceous
animals should be immersed in corrosive sublimate
and water for an hour previous to their being put into
attitudes.</p>

<p>When the joints become loose they are in general attached
by glue, but the cement is much better.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;On no account whatever use warm water in cleaning
crustaceous animals, as it is certain to change their
colors.</p>

PRESERVING SPIDERS, GALLY-WORMS, AND INSECTS.</h2>

<h3>SPIDERS.</h3>

<p>The general directions which we shall give respecting
Insects, hold good as to Spiders, only we must mention there
is considerable difficulty in preserving the bodies of Spiders,
which generally, in a very short time, shrink into a shapeless
mass. To prevent this, the body should be pricked with the
triangular awl and the contents pressed out; it should then
be stuffed with very fine carded cotton or down, which can be
pushed in by a pricker, blunted a little at the point. When
properly distended, the small aperture should be filled up with
a little cement, or a solution of gum-arabic. The legs of the
larger species, such as the Bird-catching Mygale and the
Scorpions, are also liable to shrink, and should be stuffed in
the same manner as that of the body.</p>

<p>In those species of Spiders which we have thus prepared,
and whose colors are rich and likely to be affected by the
action of the atmosphere, we must endeavor to arrest its
progress by immediately imbuing the animal, after it is set
up, with the solution of corrosive sublimate, and in an hour
after with a thin coating of a very weak white-spirit varnish;
for this purpose, take a tea-spoonful of the ordinary white-spirit
or elastic varnish, and add to it two tea-spoonfuls of
spirit of wine; apply this wash with a fine camel-hair brush,
which will quickly dry, and have a strong tendency to preserve
the color. The varnish, being thus reduced in strength,
will not leave any gloss on the insect, nor will it be at all
perceptible.</p>

<p>Mr. Samouelle, author of &ldquo;The Entomologist&rsquo;s Useful Compendium,&rdquo;
in speaking of preserving Spiders, says: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>&ldquo;The
best preserved specimens that I have seen are those where
the contents of the abdomen have been taken out and filled
with fine sand. I have preserved several in this way, and
find it answers the purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Donovan makes the following observations on the
preservation of Spiders:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To determine whether some species of Spiders could be
preserved with their natural colors, I put several into spirits
of wine; those with gibbous bodies soon after discharged a
very considerable quantity of viscid matter, and therewith all
their beautiful colors; the smallest retained their form, and
only appeared rather paler in the other colors than when they
were living.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the course of last Summer, among other Spiders,
I met with a rare species; it was of a bright yellow color,
elegantly marked with black, red, green, and purple; by some
accident it was unfortunately crushed to pieces in the chip-box
wherein it was confined, and was, therefore, thrown
aside as useless; a month or more after that time I observed
that such parts of the skin as had dried against the inside of
the box retained the original brightness of color in a considerable
degree. To further the experiment, I made a similar
attempt, with some caution, on the body of another
Spider, and, though the colors were not perfectly preserved,
they appeared distinct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From further observations I find, that if you kill the
Spider, and immediately after extract the entrails, then inflate
them by means of a blow-pipe, you may preserve them tolerably
well; you must clean them on the inside no more than is
sufficient to prevent moldiness, lest you injure the colors,
which certainly, in many kinds, depend on substance that lies
beneath the skin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scorpions, and all the Spider tribe, may be sent home in
spirits, which will preserve them perfectly, and when taken
out and dried, they will be found to have suffered nothing
from their immersion. We have seen some specimens sent
up, after being sent home in spirits, which rivaled any which
have been preserved in a recent state. The animals of this
class are particularly liable to the attacks of insects, particularly
in warm countries, on which account the mode of
transporting them and keeping them in spirits is, perhaps,
superior to all others. If, however, they are set up in a warm
climate, they should be well soaked with the solution of
corrosive sublimate, made according to the recipe of Mr.
Waterton.</p>

<p>For the setting up of this class, see the directions for preserving
insects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<h3>INSECTS.</h3>

<p>Every country of the world is replete with this extensive
and interesting class of beings, whose forms are infinitely
diversified, and whose species are the most numerous of any
class in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Before any attempt is made to collect insects, certain
apparatus must be provided, not only to enable us to secure
them, but also to preserve them after they are caught.</p>

<p>First, then, we must be provided with a quantity of wooden
boxes, from 18 to 20 inches long, 15 to 17 inches wide; and
two inches deep. These should have well-filled lids, with
hinges, and fastened by a wire catch, or small bolt. The
bottom should have a layer of cork, about the sixth of an
inch in thickness, which should be fixed down with very
strong paste, made according to our recipe; and also some
wire nails, to prevent it from springing. Over the cork
should be pasted white paper. The box should be anointed
inside with oil of petroleum. If that cannot be procured,
make an infusion of strong aromatic plants, such as cinnamon,
aloes, thyme, laurel, sage, rosemary, or cloves, and
wash the inside with it. A small packet of camphor should
be wrapped in a piece of rag, and deposited in a corner of the
box.</p>

<p>We must also be provided with a quantity of <i>Insect pins</i>, of
different sizes, corresponding with the size of the insect. The
pins used for setting should be longer than those which are
taken to the field.</p>

<p>Bottles, with mouths from an inch and a quarter to two
inches in diameter, must also be procured, and these must be
three-fourths full of spirits, such as weak brandy, rum, gin or
whisky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunting-Box.</span>&mdash;We must besides have what is termed a
hunting-box, for carrying in our pocket, when seeking after
insects. This should be made of strong pasteboard or chip,
for lightness, or, if this is no consideration, of tin. It must
be of an oblong-oval shape, rounded at the ends, for the convenience
of the pocket. It should be from eight to ten inches
long, four to five inches wide, and two and a half to three
inches deep. It must have a layer of cork both in the bottom
and top of the lid, inside, for attaching insects to, when caught
during the day. The larger insects are placed at the bottom,
and the smaller ones on the lid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Entomological.</span>&mdash;We next procure a net, constructed
similar to a bat-fowling net. This is either made of fine gauze
or coarse muslin; it may either be green or white&mdash;the latter
is the best for observing small insects which may be caught;
the green, however, is better adapted for catching Moths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
The net-rods should be made of hickory, beech, hazel, or
holly; they ought to be five feet in length, quite round, smooth,
and tapering to an obtuse point; the oblique cross-piece at
the point should be of cane, and fitted into the angular ferule;
the rod must be divided into three or four pieces, so that it
may be taken asunder and carried in the pocket; the upper
part of each joint must have a ferule affixed to it, for the
purpose of articulating the other pieces. Each joint should
have a notch or check to prevent the rod from twisting.</p>

<p>The net itself, must have a welting all around it, doubled
so as to form a groove for the reception of the rods. In the
center of the upper part or point it must have a small piece
of chamois leather, so as to form a kind of hinge; this must
be bound round the welting, and divided in the middle, so as
to prevent the cross pieces from slipping over each other; it
shows about four inches of the gauze turned up, so as to form
a bag; there are strings for the purpose of passing through
the staple, to which the net is firmly drawn on each side.
When the net is used a handle is to be held in each hand.</p>

<p>If it is intended to take insects on the wing, by means of
this net, for which it is admirably adapted, it may be folded
together in an instant. If the gauze is fine enough, and preserved
whole, even the smallest insect cannot escape. It
may be also applied in catching Coleopterous Insects, which
are never on the wing, as well as Caterpillars. When used
for this purpose the Entomologist must hold it expanded
under trees, while another must beat the branches with a
stick. Great numbers of both insects and larva will fall in the
gauze, and by this means many hundreds may be captured
in a day.</p>

<p>Another method is to spread a large table-cloth under trees
and bushes, and then beat them with a stick. An umbrella
reversed has frequently been used for the same purpose. Bose,
the celebrated naturalist, used this last method&mdash;he held the
umbrella in the left hand, while he beat the bushes with the
other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Hoop or Aquatic Net.</span>&mdash;This net is used for capturing
Aquatic Insects, which are either lurking at the bottom,
swimming through the liquid element, or adhering to plants.
It may also be successfully used in sweeping amongst grass
and low herbage, for Coleopterous Insects, and others which
are generally to be found in such situations. The socket
for the handle may be made of such dimensions as will answer
the second joint of the Entomological net-rod, which
will save carrying another handle; or a walking-stick may be
made to fit it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Vial.</span>&mdash;This may either be made of tin or crystal, and
used for collecting Coleopterous and other Creeping Insects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
The mouth should be nearly an inch wide, and a cork exactly
fitted to it, in the center of which must be inserted a small
quill, to afford air, and inserted about an inch beyond the
cork, to prevent the insects from escaping. If the bottle is
made of tin, and of a larger size, a tin tube must be introduced
into its side, and terminating externally at the surface.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Digger.</span>&mdash;The instrument is either made of iron or steel,
and is about six or seven inches in length, fixed into a turned
wooden handle. It is used for collecting the pupae of Lepidopterous
Insects, at the roots and in the clefts of the bark
of trees; and also for pulling off the bark, particularly from
decayed trees, under which many curious and rare insects are
frequently found. It is most useful with an arrow-headed
point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting Needles.</span>&mdash;Fitted into a small wooden handle, the
needle itself should be about three inches long, and about the
thickness of a small darning-needle slightly bent from about
the middle. A straight needle is used for extending the
parts of insects; at one end of the handle is the needle, and
at the other a camel&rsquo;s hair pencil, which is used for removing
any dirt or dust which may be on the insects. The pencil
may be occasionally drawn through the lips, brought to a
fine point, and used for disposing the antennæ and palpi of
insects of the minute kinds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Setting-Boards.</span>&mdash;These must be made of deal board, from
a foot or fifteen inches long, and eight or ten inches broad,
with a piece of wood run across the ends, to prevent them
from warping. They are covered with cork, which must be
perfectly smooth on the surface, with white paper pasted
over it. Several boards will be required, by persons who are
making collections, as some of the insects take a considerable
time to dry, so that they may be fit for introducing into
a cabinet.</p>

<p>The boards should be kept in a frame made for the purpose.
It should consist of a top, bottom, and two sides; the back
and front should have the frames of doors attached by small
hinges, and their centers covered with fine gauze, for the free
passage of air; the sides should have small pieces of wood
projecting from them, for the boards to rest on; which should
be at such a distance from each other that the pins may not
be displaced in pushing the boards in or drawing them out.
The frame should be placed in a dry, airy situation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Braces.</span>&mdash;These are merely small pieces of card, cut in
different forms, attached to the butterfly and other insects.
They are pinned down on the insects, to keep their wings,
etc., in a proper state, till they acquire a set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE EGGS OF INSECTS.</h3>

<p>The eggs of insects preserve their form and color in a
cabinet, in general, without much trouble. Swammerdam
had a method of preserving them when they appeared to be
giving way. He made a perforation within them with a fine
needle, pressed out their contents, afterwards inflated them
with a glass blow-pipe, and filled them with a mixture of
resin and oil of spike.</p>

<h3>THE LARVÆ, OR CATERPILLARS.</h3>

<p>The easiest way of destroying the Caterpillar is by immersion
in spirit of wine. They may be retained for a long time
in this spirits without destroying their color.</p>

<p>Mr. William Weatherhead had an ingenious mode of preserving
Larvæ. He killed the Caterpillar, as above directed,
and having made a small puncture in the tail, gently pressed
out the contents of the abdomen, and then filled the skin with
fine dry sand, and brought the animal to its natural circumference.
It is then exposed to the air to dry, and it will have
become quite hard in the course of a few hours, after which
the sand may be shaken out at the small aperture and the
Caterpillar then gummed to a piece of card.</p>

<p>Another method is, after the entrails are squeezed out, to
insert into the aperture a glass tube which has been drawn to
a very fine point. The operator must blow through this pipe
while he keeps turning the skin slowly round over a charcoal
fire; the skin soon becomes hardened, and, after being
anointed with oil of spike and resin, it may be placed in a
cabinet when dry. A small straw or pipe of grass may be
substituted for the glass pipe.</p>

<p>Some persons inject them with colored wax after they are
dried.</p>

<h3>THE PUPA.</h3>

<p>When the insects have escaped from their Pupa skin, the
skin usually retains the shape and general appearance it did
while it contained the insect. It is therefore ready for a cabinet,
without any preparation whatever. But if the animal
has not quitted its envelope, it will be necessary either to
drop the Pupa into warm water, or to heat it in a tin case before
the fire; the former mode, however, is the best, and least
liable to change the colors of the Pupa.</p>

<h3>METHOD OF BREEDING INSECTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Breeding Cages.</span>&mdash;These must be made of oak, or other
hard wood, as pine is apt to kill the Caterpillars, from its
smell of turpentine. The most convenient size for a breed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>ing
cage is eight inches in breadth, four deep, and one foot in
height. It is not proper to place within a cage more than one
species of Caterpillar, as many of them prey upon each other.
Indeed, animals of the same species will devour each other, if
left without food. The Caterpillars of insects, for the most
part, will only eat one particular kind of food, so that it is
better to have no more than one sort in a cage.</p>

<p>There must be at the bottom of the cage earth to the depth
of two inches; this should be mixed with some fine sand and
vegetable earth, if possible, to prevent it from drying. The
cages should be kept in a cool cellar or damp place, because
many insects change into the Pupa condition under the earth;
so that it would require to be somewhat moist, to prevent the
destruction of the animal. The shell or case of the Pupa also
becomes hard, if the earth is not kept moist; and, in that
event, the animal will not have sufficient strength to break its
case at the time it ought to emerge from its confinement, and
must consequently die, which but too frequently happens
from mismanagement.</p>

<p>Some seasons are more favorable than others for the production
of Caterpillars, and to keep each kind by themselves
would require an immense number of cages, as well as occupy
much time in changing the food, and paying due attention
to them. To obviate this, some persons having large
breeding cages, with a variety of food in them, which must be
cleaned out every two days, and fresh leaves given to the
Caterpillars; as, on due attention to feeding, the beauty and
vigor of the coming insects will much depend.</p>

<p>The Larvæ of insects, which feed beneath the surface of the
earth, may be bred in the following manner: Let any box that
is about three or four feet square, and two or three feet deep,
be lined internally with tin, and a number of very minute
holes be bored through the sides and bottom. Put into this
box a quantity of earth, replete with such vegetables as the
Caterpillars subsist on, and sink it into a bed of earth, so
that the surface may be exposed to the different changes of
the weather. The lid should be covered with brass or iron
net-work, to prevent their escape, and for the free admission
of air.</p>

<p>The young Entomologist should obtain a cabinet of about
thirty drawers, arranged in two tiers, and covered in with
folding doors. There is a great convenience in this size, as
the cabinet is rendered more portable, and at the same time
admits of having another of the same size, being placed above
the top of it, as the collection increases, without injuring the
uniformity, and thus the drawers may be augmented to any
extent. It is immaterial whether the cabinet is made of
mahogany or oak; sometimes they are constructed of cedar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
but seldom of pine, or any other soft wood. Small cells must
be made in the inside of the fronts for camphor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corking of Drawers.</span>&mdash;The simplest way to get the cork
is to purchase it of a cork-cutter, ready prepared, but it will
be much cheaper for the Entomologist to prepare it himself.
In this case, it should be cut into strips of about three inches
wide, with a cork-cutter&rsquo;s knife, to smooth the surface and to
divide it. The strips should be fixed in a vise, and cut to the
thickness required with a fine saw; but grease must not be
used in the operation, as it will not only prevent the cork
from adhering to the bottom of the drawer, but will also
grease the paper which should be pasted on its surface. The
black surface of the cork should be rasped down to a smooth
surface. After having reduced the slips to about three quarters
of an inch in thickness, the darkest, or worst side of the
slip should be glued down to a sheet of brown, or cartridge
paper; this should be laid on a deal board, about three feet in
length, and the width required for a drawer or box; a few fine
nails, or brads, must be driven through each piece of cork to
keep it firm and in its place until the glue be dried; by this
means, sheets of cork may be formed the size of the drawer.
All the irregularities are filed or rasped down quite to a level
surface, and then polished smooth with pumice-stone. The
sheet, thus formed and finished, is glued into the drawers.
To prevent its warping, some weights must be equally distributed
over the cork, that it may adhere firmly to the
bottom of the drawer. When quite dry, the weights are
removed, and the cork covered with fine white paper, but not
very thick. The paper is allowed to be quite damp with the
paste before it is placed on the cork, and, when dry, it will
become perfectly tight.</p>

<p>Insect cabinets should be kept in a very dry situation, otherwise
the antennæ, legs, etc., will become quite moldy. The
same evil will ensue if the insect is not perfectly dry before it
is placed in the cabinet. Should an insect be covered with
mold, it can be washed off with a camel&rsquo;s-hair pencil, dipped
in camphorated spirits of wine; in which case the insect
must be dried in a warm airy situation before being placed in
the cabinet.</p>

<p>There should always be plenty of camphor kept in the drawers,
otherwise there is great danger to be apprehended from
mites; where these exist, they are easily discovered by the dust
which is under the insects by which they are infested. In which
case they must be immediately taken out and rubbed clean with
a fine camel&rsquo;s-hair pencil, and well imbued with the solution of
corrosive sublimate, and then placed near a fire, taking care,
however, that too great a heat is not applied, as it will utterly
destroy the specimen. The Butterfly, Sphinx, and Moth tribes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
are extremely liable to the attack of mites, and should, therefore,
be frequently examined.</p>

RECEIPTS.<br />
FOR VARIOUS ARTICLES USED IN THE PRESERVATION AND SETTING
UP OF ANIMALS.</h2>

<h3>SOLUTION OF CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE.<br />
<i>Mr. Waterton&rsquo;s Method.</i></h3>

<p>Put a good large tea-spoonful of well-pounded corrosive
sublimate into a wine bottle full of alcohol (spirits of wine).
Let it stand over night, and, the next morning, draw it off
into a clean bottle. When the solution is applied to black
substance, and little white particles are perceived on them, it
will be necessary to make it weaker, by the addition of some
alcohol.</p>

<p>A black feather, dipped in the solution, and then dried,
will be a good test of the state of the solution: if it be too
strong, it will leave a whiteness upon the feather.</p>

<h3>ARSENICAL SOAP.<br />
<i>Invented by Becoeur, Apothecary, Metz.</i></h3>

<table summary="Arsenical soap recipe">
<tr><td class="padr">Arsenic in powder,</td>
<td>&#8199;2 pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="padr">Camphor,</td>
<td>&#8199;5 ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="padr">White Soap,</td>
<td>&#8199;2 pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="padr">Salt of Tartar,</td>
<td>12 ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="padr">Powdered Lime,</td>
<td>&#8199;4 ounces.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The soap must be cut in small and very thin slices, put into
a crucible with a small quantity of water, held over a gentle
fire, and frequently stirred with a wooden spatula, or a piece
of wood of any kind. When it is properly melted, the powdered
lime and salt of tartar must then be added, and thoroughly
mixed. It must now be taken off the fire, the arsenic
added gently, and stirred. The camphor must be reduced
into a powder, by beating it in a mortar, with the addition of
a little spirits of wine. The camphor must then be added, and
the composition well mixed with a spatula, while off the fire.</p>

<p>It may be again placed on the fire, to assist in making the
ingredients incorporate properly, but not much heated, as the
camphor will very rapidly escape. It may now be poured
into glazed earthen pots, and allowed to cool, after which a
piece of paper should be placed over the top, and afterwards
some sheep leather, and then set aside for use. The composition
is about the thickness of ordinary flour paste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>When it is necessary to use the soap, put as much as will
answer the purpose into a preserve pot, and add to it about
an equal proportion of water. This is applied to the skin or
feathers with a bristle brush.</p>

<p>N. B. It should be kept as close as possible, and used with
caution, as it is a deadly poison.</p>

<p>The above is the receipt made use of at the Jardin des
Plantes, Paris.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Laurent&rsquo;s Receipt.</i></p>

<p>A distinguished French naturalist, Laurent, recommends
the following composition, after ten years experience, for preserving
the skins of stuffed animals. He observes, at the
same time, that it penetrates them with greater readiness,
and preserves them much better than any preparation which
has hitherto been in use.</p>

<table summary="Laurent's receipt">
<tr><td class="padr">Arseniate of Potash,</td>
<td>2 drachms.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="padr">Sulphate of Alumine,</td>

<tr><td class="padr">Essence of Thyme,</td>
<td>3 drops.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The arseniate of potash, sulphate of alumine, and soap, are
to be placed in a vial, with a large mouth, and the spirits of
wine to be poured on them, at a heat of <i>twenty five</i> degrees,
and they will be perfectly combined in twenty-four hours.
The essence of thyme is then added, when the vial must be
carefully corked. This composition is to be shaken together,
before it is made use of, and it must be spread over the skin
of the animal or bird with a brush.</p>

<h3>SOLUTION OF PEARL-ASHES.</h3>

<p>Two ounces of pearl-ash to one gallon of water.</p>

<h3>ANNEALED IRON WIRE.</h3>

<p>Take common iron wire, make it red-hot, and suffer it to
cool gradually; this renders it soft and pliable, so that it may
be easily bent in any direction.</p>

<h3>CEMENT.</h3>

<table summary="Cement recipe">

<p>The whole to be dissolved, and mixed well with water into
thick paste.</p>

<p>This is well adapted for attaching different objects, and
especially for fixing shells to pasteboard, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<h3>GUM PASTE.</h3>

<table summary="Gum paste recipe">
<tr><td class="padr">White Sugar Candy,</td>
<td class="tdr">2 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="padr">Common Gum-Arabic,</td>
<td class="tdr">4 oz.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Let these be melted in a pot of hot water, and then strained
through a linen or horse-hair sieve. When properly dissolved,
add to it two table-spoonfuls of starch, or hair-powder, and
mix the whole well together. This paste may be used for many
purposes, and it never spoils. It may be dried, and by pouring
a little warm water on it, it will soon be ready for use. If
it is wished to be all melted, and hurriedly, the pot containing
it should be placed in warm water or sand.</p>

<h3>FLOUR PASTE.</h3>

<p>Make flour paste in the ordinary way, and add to it a small
portion of the solution of corrosive sublimate, or powdered
corrosive sublimate. This will prevent the attack of mites,
to which paste is very liable when dried. This paste may be
dried into a cake, and moistened when required.</p>

<h3>SOLUTION OF GUM-ARABIC.</h3>

<p>The solution of gum-arabic is made by simply adding water
to it. When used as a varnish, or for attaching objects, it is
extremely apt to get too brittle in very warm weather, and to
crack or split off in scales; to prevent this, a quarter of an
ounce of white or brown sugar candy must be added to two
ounces of gum-arabic.</p>

<h3>PAPER, PASTE, GUMMED.</h3>

<p>Take a coffee-pot, filled with water, and add to it a
quantity of paper, which has been slightly sized, like that
used for printing engravings. Let it boil for three hours, and
when the water has evaporated, boil it again for a similar
length of time. Take out the paper, and squeeze it well in a
colander, and then pound it in a mortar, until it is reduced
to a very fine paste. It must then be dried. When it is
required for use, add to it some of the solution of gum-arabic;
and keep it in a pot for use.</p>

<h3>POLLEN POWDER.</h3>

<p>The paper made as above directed, when well dried, is
pounded in a mortar till it becomes a very fine powder; it is
then put into a tin pepper-box, and when any of the parts of
Parrots&rsquo; bills, etc., are wished to have this powdered appearance,
a little of the solution of gum-arabic is washed over the
part with a camel&rsquo;s-hair pencil, and the powder dusted on it
and allowed to dry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<h3>RED VARNISH.</h3>

<p>Take a stick of red sealing-wax, beat it down with a hammer,
and then put it into a vial, with an ounce of strong
spirit of wine, which will dissolve it within four or five hours.
It may be applied to any part with a camel&rsquo;s-hair pencil, and it
will dry in less than five minutes.</p>

<p>Black, yellow, and green, or indeed any color of varnish,
may be made from sealing-wax of these various colors.</p>

<p>To those unacquainted with the combination of colors we
may mention that a mixture of blue and yellow produces
green; pink and blue makes purple; red and yellow, orange;
black, red, and yellow, brown; black and blue, gray. These
may be varied, in an infinity of shades, by either color predominating,
and by the addition of other colors.</p>

<h3>LUTING FOR RENDERING BOTTLES AIR-TIGHT.</h3>

<ul><li>Common Resin.</li>
<li>Red Ochre reduced into a fine powder.</li>
<li>Yellow Wax.</li>
<li>Oil of Turpentine.</li>
</ul>

<p>These must be melted over a fire in the following manner:
and the vessel in which it is made should be capable of holding
three times the quantity required, to allow room for boiling
up. An earthenware pipkin with a handle is the best
thing for the purpose, and a lid must be made of tin to fit it.
The luting will be rendered more or less brittle, or elastic, as
the red ochre prevails:</p>

<p>The wax is first melted, and then the resin; the ochre is
then added in small quantities, and stirred quickly with a
spatula each time. When all the ochre has been added, it
must be allowed to boil six or eight minutes; the turpentine
is then added, and briskly stirred with the spatula, and continue
to boil it. There is considerable risk of the mixture
taking fire, and should it do so, the lid must immediately be
put on the vessel to extinguish it.</p>

<p>To ascertain the consistence of the luting, a little must be,
from time to time, dropped on a cool plate, or flat piece of
iron. If it is too soft, more of the ochre must be added to it;
and if too hard, additional wax and turpentine.</p>

<h3>TOW AND FLAX SLIVERS.</h3>

<p>These are fillets of prepared tow and flax, of from one to
three inches in breadth. They are extremely uniform in their
thickness, being made to weight, and can easily be procured
from any flax-spinning mill, at a moderate price per
pound weight.</p>

<h3>METHOD OF MAKING ENAMEL-EYES FOR ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>Much of the character and expression of animals depends
upon their eyes; it will, therefore, be evident that great attention
is necessary in the artificial imitation of these.</p>

<p>In this operation, a pipe of baked earth is used, or a tube
of glass six or seven inches in length, at the end of which a
little white enamel is placed. This is placed to the flame, so
that it may be blown. This enamel forms a globe, whose dimensions
depend upon the quantity of air introduced. When
this globe is of the size wished, we place in the middle, and
perpendicularly to the point of the pipe, the quantity of enamel
necessary to form the enamel. The second enamel is
then incorporated with the first by presenting it to the flame,
while attention is paid to turn the pipe gradually round, so
that the enamel may diffuse itself equally, and the iris be exactly
circular. If it is required that this iris should be of
various colors, like that of man for example, small filaments
of enamel are distributed in diverging rays of the suitable
color; the eye is then placed in the flame, until these have incorporated
with the iris, after which the pupil is placed as
before directed, and the glass applied as before directed.</p>

<p>During this operation, the globe is almost certain of sinking
down, partly from the air escaping, partly from the heat,
and from the pressure which is used in applying the different
substances; air must again be supplied from time to time to
prevent it from losing its form. This becomes particularly
necessary when glass is applied, and when it is extended over
the whole surface of the iris.</p>

<p>The eye having got its form and size, the pipe is taken
away. To effect this, after the air has been introduced, the
entrance of the pipe is stopped with the finger, and the back
part of the eye exposed to the flame; when the air contained
in the globe, and rarified by the pipe, comes through at the
place where the flame has most action. This opening is prolonged
by turning the point of the flat pincers, or an iron-wire,
all round the pipe; one point only is left by which the eye remains
fixed. It is then warmed equally all over, after which
it is exposed to a gentle heat, and when it again cools, it is
separated from the pipe.</p>

<h3>ARTICLES REQUIRED FOR SKINNING AND MOUNTING QUADRUPEDS,
BIRDS, REPTILES, AND FISHES.</h3>

<ol class="paras">

<li>A box containing scalpels of different shapes; a pair of
scissors with pointed blades, and two or three pointed
forceps of different sizes, the extremities of one of which
ought to be indented.</li>

<li>Two flat pincers, or pliers, large and small.</li>

<li>A round pincer for turning wire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></li>

<li>A cutting pincer for wire.</li>

<li>A hammer.</li>

<li>Two files.</li>

<li>A triangular.</li>

<li>Points for perforating holes.</li>

<li>A saddler&rsquo;s awl for drilling holes; also various shoemaker&rsquo;s
awls, which will be found useful.</li>

<li>Brushes of different sizes for putting the preservative on
the animals&rsquo; and birds&rsquo; skins, and for smoothing and
dusting the feathers.</li>

<li>An assortment of iron-wire of all sizes.</li>

<li>Flax and tow, coarse cotton. When these cannot be
had, untwisted ropes or cords. A quantity of tow and
flax slivers for twisting round the leg-bones of small
quadrupeds and birds.</li>

<li>Some small hardwood meshes for assisting in stuffing.</li></ol>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS TO TRAVELERS.</h3>

<p>The best means of procuring living animals is by applying
to the natives of the different countries, who are accustomed
to their habits, and the situation in which they are likely to
be found, and to take them in traps and snares. They are
also more likely to be able to find their retreats, so that they
may take these animals in a young state, and also birds in
their nests.</p>

<p>By thus securing animals while young, they are much more
likely to reach home in a living state. Every exertion should
be used to render them familiar, when, being habituated to
the appearance of man, they will be more able to resist the
effects of a tedious sea-voyage than those which have been
taken when wild, and are under a continued degree of excitement.
Every care should be taken to soothe and caress
them; and there is no animal whose manners cannot be softened
by gentle treatment. During fine weather, they should
be allowed to take exercise on the deck, as nothing is so injurious
to their health and growth as being long pent up in a
small cage. While thus confined, it will be obvious that they
require a much smaller portion of food then when they can
have sufficient room to exercise themselves. Many of these
animals are lost from overfeeding. Their diet should be
given with great regularity, but always in such quantity as
they can easily digest.</p>

<p>Next to food, cleanliness is of the utmost importance, and
if this requires too much of the attention of those who are
bringing them home, it will be easy to procure the assistance
of some of the crew. And unless this is strictly attended to,
there is little chance of preserving their health.</p>

<p>When animals&rsquo; skins are imported, it is also necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
bring the head and feet. Those of the mammalia, which can
be put into a barrel or bottle, should be preserved entire in
spirits.</p>

<p>In the event of not being able to transport the carcass the
next best thing is to bring the skeleton along with the skin.
It will not be necessary to mount these. All that is required
is to boil the bones, take off the flesh, and dry them. Afterwards
all the bones belonging to the same skeleton should be
put in a bag by themselves, taking care to fill up the bag
with dried moss, or any other substance which will prevent
friction. The more effectually to secure this, the small and
tender bones ought to be wrapped in paper. It is of the utmost
consequence that not a bone should be lost.</p>

<p>In shooting birds, it is of much importance not to use the
shot too large; indeed, it ought to be proportioned, as nearly
as possible, to the size of the bird to be shot at. When the
bird is killed, the blood must be carefully wiped away, and a
little cotton must be put into the bill to prevent the blood
flowing from it to injure the feathers. The wound should also
be stuffed with cotton.</p>

<p>Birds should be skinned as soon as possible, as the feathers
are apt to fall off if kept too long. The os coccygis must be
kept attached to the skin. If several individuals of the same
species be killed, one should, if possible, be preserved entire
in spirits, with the whole muscles of the body. If the bird
has a fleshy crest, it ought to be preserved in spirits.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost consequence to procure the male, female
and young, and these at different ages, besides, as many
species are subject to great variety, in their progress from the
young to the adult state. This is more particularly the case
with Eagles and Hawks, many of which have been described
as different species in their immature state. The eggs and
nest should also be procured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reptiles.</span>&mdash;The chief thing to be attended to in skinning
reptiles is not to injure the scales; and in the lizard kind care
must be taken not to break the tail. But for all the smaller
and middle-sized species the best mode is to preserve them in
spirits; and of the larger kinds, which are skinned, the skeletons
ought to be kept. The flesh should be taken away with
knives and scalpels as well as possible, and the bones thoroughly
dried and packed in a box with cotton or grass, and
they can be articulated after they are brought home. When
the skeletons are too large they may be separated into convenient
parts for packing.</p>
